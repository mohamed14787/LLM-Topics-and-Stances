    "content": "How well does the \"Middle Kingdom\" know the \"land of virtue?\" Experts in China recently compiled information about German politics and society. Hot topics include Germany's political shift to the right and protectionism.\nIs Alice Weidel really the most popular German politician in China? The leader of the populist, far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is probably the only member of Germany's Parliament, the Bundestag, who speaks Chinese.\nAs a student, Weidel researched and wrote her doctoral thesis on the pension system in China. Many reels about Weidel are circulating on Chinese state-controlled social media.\nThe designated AfD candidate for chancellor in the 2025 election is popular in China because she opposes US and EU integration policies.\nThe fact that Weidel could have a chance of becoming German Chancellor is one of countless cliches in China.\nThe social elite in China is well aware that cooperation between China as the world's second-largest economy and Germany as the third-largest can only be sustainable if the public has an objective and nuanced image of Germany.\nChina's \"Annual Development Report of Germany (2024)\" was published in mid-November.\nThe publisher is the German Research Center of Tongji University in Shanghai. Its predecessor, the \"German Medical School for Chinese in Shanghai,\" was founded in 1907 by the German naval doctor Erich Paulun.\nThe 386-page study has not taken into account the latest changes in Germany's politics, such as the coalition government's collapse, and the upcoming snap elections.\nThe majority of the data used is as of 2023. Nevertheless, it is very informative to read how intensively and thoroughly Chinese researchers are studying Germany.\nOne of the dominant themes is the rise of the AfD. According to the authors, many people in Germany are worried about the overall political and economic situation.\nThe AfD is said to be taking advantage of these concerns to divide and polarize society. \"The strong tailwinds for right-wing populism and its party pose huge challenges for the other established political parties,\" said Xuan Li, Professor at Tongji University.\nWhether the shift to the right can be reversed depends on whether \"the other parties manage to respond appropriately to the mood of the electorate,\" Xuan said.\nThe right-wing populists are seen as advocating a new foreign policy that challenges the established \"politically correct\" alliance with the United States.\nAfter Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, for example, the AfD in the Bundestag called for the abolition of sanctions against Russia. \"The political tug-of-war between the AfD and the others will immediately put relations between the US and Germany to the test,\" the authors say.\nOn his trip to the United States in February, Chancellor Olaf Scholz described relations between the US and Germany as \"intensive, close and amicable in a way that has probably not been the case for many years and decades.\"\nAs if the political scientists from China had already foreseen the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election, they made a prediction about the future development of the trans-Atlantic alliance before the editorial deadline.\n\"If Donald Trump were to be reelected, the risk of new disputes and even conflicts arising between Germany and the US in terms of defense and trade would be extremely high,\" the authors wrote.\n\"An appropriate response to the unpredictability of the new US administration would then be a difficult undertaking. After all, we are seeing a surge of nationalism in economic life across borders, from the US to Germany and many other European countries,\" they continued.\n\"This mixture,\" they wrote, \"will put a heavy strain on the future of relations between Germany and the US and the alliance between the two countries in the Ukraine war.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe war in Ukraine is also a joint challenge for Germany and China, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made clear during her trip to Beijing earlier this week.\nBoth countries face immense hurdles in overcoming such challenges, Wulf Linzenich, chairman of the German-Chinese Business Association (DCW), said at the organization's annual conference in Düsseldorf on Tuesday.\n\"How can we find a balance between increased cooperation with the US and maintaining an equal partnership with China? The economic engine of the coming decades will undoubtedly be in Asia. Europe will remain an important partner for China in the future. A clear and coherent strategy that takes both sides into account is essential,\" said Linzenich.\nBeijing has not really warmed to the Green foreign minister, as the German government's China Strategy 2023 came from her department.\nThe strategy defines China as a \"partner, competitor and rival.\"\nAccording to Beijing, the political focus is more on the latter aspect. It also calls on the German economy to \"de-risk,\" where dependence on China for critical sectors is to be avoided through diversification.\nThe authors of the report, Kou Kou and Shi Shiwei, write that de-risking is expensive and fraught.\nGermany's economy would have to pay a high price for the political decision to restrict cooperation with China, its largest trading partner globally for the past eight years, they wrote.\n\"Germany is now acutely threatened with a slip into recession,\" according to the authors. \"The leeway in fiscal policy has been exhausted. The German government lacks support for its China strategy within its own ranks and in many other EU countries. The real effects of de-risking fall well short of political expectations.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe authors write that competition is healthy.\n\"Reform and opening up an objective cooperation without ideological disputes have brought tangible benefits to both partners,\" they write. \"As the economy strengthens, Chinese companies are competing with the German economy in some areas. But healthy competition does not necessarily have a negative impact on economic cooperation.\"\nChina is irreversibly integrated into the global economy and will continue to have a significant impact on markets and the digital space in the future, Andreas Schmitz, president of the Düsseldorf Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said at the DCW conference. This also applies worldwide to climate protection and the definition of industry standards.\n\"The People's Republic continues to be an important market for German and European companies. But China also plays an important role for the European and German economy in terms of raw materials and primary products now, and even more so in the future with regard to the innovative strength of the country and its companies,\" continued the IHK President.\n\"Made in China\" was not always meant in a positive way in the past. \"Today we say 'Made by China'.

    "content": "Deutsche Bahn is investing big in addressing public perceptions of the German national rail carrier as hugely dysfunctional. But political disarray in Berlin has knocked it off track.\nTyler Bosselman was wearing the dark blue vest and the red tie of a Deutsche Bahntrain driver. As he sat comfortably in the operator's seat of his regional DB train, the landscapes of southern Germany rushed by outside, reflected in his sunglasses.\nConstruction is underway on one of the routes that the 24-year-old Bosselman drives. It's the busy Riedbahn route between Frankfurt and Mannheim in Germany, which is getting new switches and signals to make rail traffic run more smoothly. The goal is to finish the overhaul by the end of December, and Bosselman hopes that the upgrade will make Deutsche Bahn \"more reliable overall.\"\nReconstruction of the Riedbahn route marks the beginning of what Germany's state-owned railway operator touted as a reboot of the company, with routes to Hanover, Hamburg and other busy sections of its nationwide network set to follow soon.\nDB's so-called comprehensive reconstruction plan involves a total of 40 major construction projects and aims to ensure that the operator's infamously unpunctual trains will be running on time again by the end of the decade. At the program's launch this summer, German Transportation Minister Volker Wissing called it Germany's \"largest reconstruction and modernization program in recent decades.\"\nDB's plans could soon come to a screeching halt. The collapse of the three-party German government coalition on November 6, and fresh elections to be held on February 23 next year at the earliest, mean the country is stuck in political limbo for half a year, and so is funding for the rail program.\nMartin Burkert, chairman of the EVG rail workers union, has already warned that, without a 2025 national budget, there would be a lack of money to carry on with the projects. \"Years of planning work to finally get the infrastructure up to date and improve the punctuality and capacity of the network is now at risk,\" Burkert told the German news agency, dpa, recently.\nBosselman knows all too well how necessary the overhaul of DB's rail network is. Every day, the train driver navigates his engine through a web of construction sites in and around the Frankfurt rail hub. \"It's like when you are going to a casino. It's like you're gambling and hoping that you are on time. During rush hours, there is absolutely no guarantee that you are getting there in any reasonable time,\" Bosselman told DW.\nAn active union member, Bosselman can share many stories about what goes wrong at DB. While most regional trains still manage to be fairly punctual, he says, almost one in three long-distance trains in Germany now arrives late. Yet they are usually given priority on the crowded tracks thus holding up slower trains or idling them on sidetracks until they pass by. \"It doesn't matter if it is on a Monday, a Wednesday or any other day in the week. You can basically mark the day in your calendar that you make it into Frankfurt central station without having to slow down once.\"\nDB's infrastructure backlog is not only evident in the carrier's lack of punctuality, but has also increasingly manifested itself in a thinned-out network that has been shrinking for years. Surprisingly, this has happened against the backdrop of rising demand for its services, with goods volumes and passenger numbers having increased at the same time.\nBosselman said you could see the ruins left by a chronically underfunded rail company every day. As we pass a steel bridge, he points to rusty, moss-covered tracks nearby, which he says have been disused for a long time. \"You could have a much higher volume of traffic here, if you invested a few euros into this replacement track.\"\nAt the end of the 1990s, Germany was hit by a severe economic crisis, with the government cutting spending wherever possible. Deutsche Bahn, which is fully owned by the state, became an easy target for the cuts leading to a dramatic decline of investment in rail infrastructure.\nAlthough this has changed in recent years, the government still spends comparatively little money on Germany's railway infrastructure. According to the Pro-Rail Alliance — a lobby group that unites nonprofit pro-rail campaigners with railway sector companies — Germany spends about €115 ($121) per capita on its railways annually, while countries such as Austria or Switzerland invest three to four times as much.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Federal Court of Auditors — an independent body that audits the federal budget and oversees the management of public funds — highlighted the years of neglect and current underfunding in a recent report. It declared Deutsche Bahn a \"case for restructuring,\" and lambasted the government for having \"failed to address key rail policy questions for three decades.\"\nThe comprehensive reconstruction plan was supposed to be the answer to many of DB's woes, with the government earmarking €30 billion-€50 billion for the endeavor over the next three years. But now, after the collapse of the government, Germany has no budget for the next year which could threaten the funding for some of the rail projects.\nChristian Böttger, a professor at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economics whose research areas include railroads, said he believed that DB would get the money one day, but only after a new government has been formed. \"A cancellation by a new government seems politically very unlikely to me, but even the already imminent postponement of construction projects is, of course, a disaster,\" he told DW.\nBosselman is not too worried about deep cuts to railway funding in the future. He said politicians had realized that DB is part of Germany's \"critical infrastructure.\" However, he believes that the current budget shortfalls will come at the expense of DB's reboot. \"In Germany, roads have always taken precedence over rail, and that's why I feel that cuts to rail are more likely.\"\nBosselman intends to stay positive, as he believes that there's already \"a lot of negativity going around\" in German politics. \"If you kind of give in to all that negativity, your life won't be too positive down the road,\" he said. \"I can't see myself sad or disappointed in everything,\" he added. \"There is always something to look up for.\"\nSo, instead of complaining about his employer, he aims to boost his career at the end of the year with a master's degree in railway operations, which, he said, could be a \"door-opener to a leadership role\" so that he can try to \"transform Deutsche Bahn from the inside.\"\nAnd some German passengers, though small in numbers, also have a reason for hope regarding improvements in rail services. DB announced a few weeks ago that the reconstruction of the Riedbahn would soon be completed, with service on the route scheduled to resume by mid-December — surprisingly for the rail operator, this would be right on schedule and just in time to complete the first project of the reconstruction plan ahead of the country's fresh elections.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the German ruling coalition collapsed on November 4. It has been corrected to state that the coalition collapsed on November 6.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

According to the authors, many people in Germany are worried about the overall political and economic situation.\nThe AfD is said to be taking advantage of these concerns to divide and polarize society. \"The strong tailwinds for right-wing populism and its party pose huge challenges for the other established political parties,\" said Xuan Li, Professor at Tongji University.\nWhether the shift to the right can be reversed depends on whether \"the other parties manage to respond appropriately to the mood of the electorate,\" Xuan said.\nThe right-wing populists are seen as advocating a new foreign policy that challenges the established \"politically correct\" alliance with the United States.\nAfter Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, for example, the AfD in the Bundestag called for the abolition of sanctions against Russia. \"The political tug-of-war between the AfD and the others will immediately put relations between the US and Germany to the test,\" the authors say.\nOn his trip to the United States in February, Chancellor Olaf Scholz described relations between the US and Germany as \"intensive, close and amicable in a way that has probably not been the case for many years and decades.\"\nAs if the political scientists from China had already foreseen the outcome of the 2024 US presidential election, they made a prediction about the future development of the trans-Atlantic alliance before the editorial deadline.\n\"If Donald Trump were to be reelected, the risk of new disputes and even conflicts arising between Germany and the US in terms of defense and trade would be extremely high,\" the authors wrote.\n\"An appropriate response to the unpredictability of the new US administration would then be a difficult undertaking. After all, we are seeing a surge of nationalism in economic life across borders, from the US to Germany and many other European countries,\" they continued.\n\"This mixture,\" they wrote, \"will put a heavy strain on the future of relations between Germany and the US and the alliance between the two countries in the Ukraine war.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe war in Ukraine is also a joint challenge for Germany and China, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock made clear during her trip to Beijing earlier this week.\nBoth countries face immense hurdles in overcoming such challenges, Wulf Linzenich, chairman of the German-Chinese Business Association (DCW), said at the organization's annual conference in Düsseldorf on Tuesday.\n\"How can we find a balance between increased cooperation with the US and maintaining an equal partnership with China? The economic engine of the coming decades will undoubtedly be in Asia. Europe will remain an important partner for China in the future. A clear and coherent strategy that takes both sides into account is essential,\" said Linzenich.\nBeijing has not really warmed to the Green foreign minister, as the German government's China Strategy 2023 came from her department.\nThe strategy defines China as a \"partner, competitor and rival.\"\nAccording to Beijing, the political focus is more on the latter aspect. It also calls on the German economy to \"de-risk,\" where dependence on China for critical sectors is to be avoided through diversification.\nThe authors of the report, Kou Kou and Shi Shiwei, write that de-risking is expensive and fraught.\nGermany's economy would have to pay a high price for the political decision to restrict cooperation with China, its largest trading partner globally for the past eight years, they wrote.\n\"Germany is now acutely threatened with a slip into recession,\" according to the authors. \"The leeway in fiscal policy has been exhausted. The German government lacks support for its China strategy within its own ranks and in many other EU countries. The real effects of de-risking fall well short of political expectations.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe authors write that competition is healthy.\n\"Reform and opening up an objective cooperation without ideological disputes have brought tangible benefits to both partners,\" they write. \"As the economy strengthens, Chinese companies are competing with the German economy in some areas. But healthy competition does not necessarily have a negative impact on economic cooperation.\"\nChina is irreversibly integrated into the global economy and will continue to have a significant impact on markets and the digital space in the future, Andreas Schmitz, president of the Düsseldorf Chamber of Industry and Commerce, said at the DCW conference. This also applies worldwide to climate protection and the definition of industry standards.\n\"The People's Republic continues to be an important market for German and European companies. But China also plays an important role for the European and German economy in terms of raw materials and primary products now, and even more so in the future with regard to the innovative strength of the country and its companies,\" continued the IHK President.\n\"Made in China\" was not always meant in a positive way in the past. \"Today we say 'Made by China'.

    "content": "Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany's leader.\nFriedrich Merz has a good chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor. As the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the conservative parliamentary group that includes Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), he will be the bloc's top candidate, taking on the Social Democrats (SPD) in the February 23 general election. Though Merz has never held government office, opinion polls suggest that he is the favorite in the race.\n \nAt the age of 69, Merz would become the oldest person to take office as Germany's head of government since Konrad Adenauer, who was 73 years old when he was sworn in as the first chancellor of the Federal Republic in 1949.\n \nMerz has had two political lives: one before Angela Merkel came to power as chancellor in 2005 and the second after she exited in 2021.\nHe had slowly withdrawn from politics after Merkel's initial election as German chancellor. Merkel, who is often referred to as Merz's \"nemesis,\" was a pragmatist and moderate who did not see eye to eye with the staunch conservative Friedrich Merz.\nHe then took a break from politics in 2009, returning to the Bundestag only in 2021 after Merkel had retired.\nMerz hails from the rural Sauerland area of Germany's most-populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. He is a wealthy corporate lawyer, a father of three and a Catholic. He started his political career as amember of the European Parliament for the CDU in 1989, at the age of 33. Five years later, in 1994, he switched to the German lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, where his sharp oratory skills drew attention. He became an influential member of the conservative parliamentary group (CDU/CSU).\nMerz's withdrawal from politics dovetailed with successes in the private sector: From 2005 to 2021, he was a member of the international law firm Mayer Brown LLP and held top positions on supervisory and administrative boards. From 2016 to 2020, Merz was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager.\nIn 2022, on Merz's third attempt at the post, the CDU elected him as party leader.\nMerz had a reputation as an economically liberal representative of the conservative CDU wing. In 2008 he wrote a book entitled \"Mehr Kapitalismus wagen\" (Dare More Capitalism) championing a liberal economic policy, slashing bureaucracy, reducing social benefits and cutting taxes for companies.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the 1990s, Merz was in the minority even in the conservative CDU when he voted against liberalizing the abortion law and against preimplantation genetic diagnostics in the Bundestag. When parliament passed a bill to criminalize marital rape like any other rape in 1997, Merz voted against it.\nMerz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as \"ugly\" wind turbines.\nHe drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner's wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.\nMerz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees.\nOn a TV talk show, he said female school teachers in Germany were experiencing a lack of respect from what he called \"little pashas,\" apparently referring to sons of Muslim parents.\nThat remark came only weeks after Merz referred to some displaced Ukrainians as \"welfare tourists\" — claiming that many of them had come to Germany seeking safety, only to then travel back and forth between both countries once they have secured social benefits.\nMerz later offered an apology of sorts: \"I regret using the word 'welfare tourism.' It was an inaccurate description of a problem observed in individual cases.\"\nMerz previously complained about \"problems with foreigners\" and insisted on a German \"Leitkultur\" (dominant culture),  a term dating back to the 1990s that many argue is a call for compulsory assimilation.\nHe represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nShortly after Germany's center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz's coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming.\nMerz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Defense Minister Boris Pistorius is the most popular German politician. Many party supporters would like to see him as the SPD's candidate for chancellor.\nIn recent days, Boris Pistorius has been talked about as a possible candidate for chancellor for his center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nAfter the collapse of the center-left coalition government at the beginning of November, this discussion has gathered pace: Pistorius was repeatedly brought into play as an alternative to Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who wants to lead his party into the election campaign again as the chancellor candidate, despite his poor approval ratings.\nSupport for Pistorius' possible candidacy comes from the rank-and-file of his Social Democrat Party as well as from prominent SPD members. Pistorius has refused to be drawn into the discussion, and has repeatedly emphasized his loyalty to Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhen Pistorius was offered the position of German defense minister in January 2023, he was confident enough to accept what is often regarded as a hot seat in Berlin politics. Whoever is in charge of the chronically underfunded and poorly equipped Bundeswehr has been likely to make many mistakes.\nPistorius took office as defense minister on January 19, 2023, at a difficult time. The Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent German arms shipments to Kyiv revealed once again how poorly equipped the Bundeswehr was. Handing over some of its most powerful weapons systems to Ukraine, the Bundeswehr was left nearly empty-handed.\nHowever, Pistorius acted swiftly and decisively. A one-time appropriation budget of €100 billion ($105 billion) for the German army was approved by the government in June 2022, and Pistorius pushed ahead with a number of major arms purchases. This included urgently needed air defense systems, helicopters, tanks and frigate warships.\nPistorius pushed for a Bundeswehr brigade — around 5,000 soldiers — to be stationed permanently in Lithuania, where it is due to be operational by 2027. This decision marked a first in the history of German defense policy and was not without controversy, partly due to the high costs involved — all the more so as Pistorius had failed to secure significantly more money for the German army in the regular defense budget for 2025.\nPistorius' stated aim has been to successfully transform the German armed forces and make them operational again, while at the same time supporting Ukraine. The German armed forces are to become \"ready for war\" again, as he put it — a choice of words that some critics found too aggressive. But for Pistorius, this simply means \"being ready to go to war in order to avoid having one.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nPistorius quickly earned the respect and esteem of both the Cabinet and the troops. His hands-on, unpretentious manner and his straight talking has gone down well with the soldiers.\nWithin weeks of taking office, the new defense minister had climbed to the top of popularity polls, ahead of his colleagues in the Cabinet and Chancellor Scholz himself.\nPistorius is a candidate for the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag, in his home district of Hanover in Lower Saxony. This is where he gained his political experience at the local and state level, serving for many years as regional interior minister.\nBorn on March 14, 1960, Pistorius grew up with his two brothers in Osnabrück, a northern city in the German state of Lower Saxony. His mother was a local SPD politician, and he himself joined the SPD in 1976. After doing a business apprenticeship and the completion of his compulsory military service, he studied law. He then worked as a lawyer before deciding to pursue a career in local and state politics.\nIn 2006, Pistorius became mayor of Osnabrück, where he had always been a loyal supporter of the local VFL soccer team. When the Social Democrats won the state election in Lower Saxony in 2013, he became interior minister in the new coalition government between the SPD and the Greens.\nIn this new position, Pistorius made domestic security his main issue, strengthening the police force and initiating legislation to tighten gun laws. Pistorius remained interior minister in Lower Saxony for 10 years.\nBut while his political career was taking off, it was a difficult time for him privately. In 2015, his wife, with whom he has two daughters, died of cancer. Pistorius, who has described himself as \"a real family man,\" remarried at the end of 2023.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "The German chancellor addressed lawmakers for the first time since his three-way coalition collapsed last week.\nGermany's conservative opposition sharply criticized center-left German Chancellor Scholz in a parliamentary session Wednesday that also saw more than 100 lawmakers back a ban of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany party (AfD). \n  \nThe chancellor is trying to drum up support for legislation ahead of early elections set for February.\nScholz on Wednesday confirmed that a vote of confidence had been set for December 16, after the governing SPD/Greens/FDP coalition collapsed last week.\nThese live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading.\nBelow, you can read about developments in Germany's move toward early elections as they happened on Wednesday, November 13, 2024.\nDW Chief Political Editor Michaela Küfner described the contentious atmosphere in Berlin on Wednesday, outlining the impasses that both Chancellor Olaf Scholz and former Finance Minister Christian Lindner described in their remarks.\nKüfner said Scholz told parliamentarians that he had no choice but to fire Lindner last week, triggering the collapse of the ruling coalition. Scholz said Lindner had been trying to handcuff him into deciding between supporting Ukraine and making budget cuts at home or having no access to spending at all.\nDW's Küfner reported that Lindner, too, addressed fellow lawmakers. He argued that Scholz had been the problem, offering his finance minister slim options as well. Lindner said that ultimately his choice was between upholding the constitution or not.\nBavarian State Premier Markus Söder on Wednesday demanded expediency from Germany's outgoing SPD/Greens/FDP coalition, demanding, \"The confidence question must be put immediately and not next year\" and adding, \"there must be no tactical delays.\"\nSöder was in Berlin Wednesday to meet with Christian Democratic Union (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz after the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government last week.\nSöder, who leads the CDU's Bavarian sister party the Christian Social Union (CSU), was himself in contention for the top spot on the CSU/CDU ballot early next year but bowed out in favor of Merz.\nSpeaking to reporters, Söder said, \"the chancellor question is decided. Friedrich Merz is doing it.\"\nDespite differences, Söder said he fully backed Merz, stressing that they were united by the shared aim of unseating the current government to \"get Germany back on track.\"\nMerz thanked Söder for his support and said his party had the \"firm intention of taking over leadership responsibility in this country again.\"\nBy stepping aside, Söder has left the path to the Chancellory open for Merz, an ambitious politician who served (in a strained relationship) under former Chancellor Angela Merkel before taking a job at the investment firm BlackRock and then returning to politics as an economic liberal with right-leaning tendencies on social issues and especially immigration.\nBavarian State Premier Markus Söder on Wednesday leveled harsh criticism at Olaf Scholz.\nSöder, who leads the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of the larger center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU), said Scholz and Vice Chancellor Robert Habeck of the Greens were to blame for the \"disastrous situation\" that Germany now finds itself in.\n\"It takes courage to act as if you having nothing at all to do with the whole disaster. That is, ultimately, it was wholly failed finance policies that are the cause of all of Germany's budget problems.\"\nHabeck, said Söder, had become the face of the crisis, and continued to lambaste the outgoing coalition, saying it had left Germany, \"ungovernable.\"\nSöder's appearance in Berlin marked the first time the Bavarian had ever spoken in the Bundestag and he pulled no punches delivering his message, saying the coalition had severely damaged Germany's reputation at home and abroad.\n\"Laughter in Moscow, wrinkled foreheads in Europe and a grin from the US. You will go down as the weakest government in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\"\nFDP leader and former German Finance Minister Christian Lindneraccused Chancellor Olaf Scholz of failed economic policies. Commenting on his resignation from the Chancellor last week, Lindner said: \"Sometimes a dismissal is also a liberation.\"\n\"Olaf Scholz's text says agenda, but there is no agenda in the text,\" he said in the Bundestag, referring to a Chancellor's paper on economic policy presented to the coalition committee last week.\n\"If you're just running around in circles, you can't lead a progressive coalition,\" Lindner said.\nHowever, Lindner still believes that Germany has what it takes to overcome the economic slump. \"Germany still has the potential for a strong comeback. We have the know-how, the capital, the brains,\" he said.\nTo achieve this, an economic policy that has been holding Germany back for more than a decade must be changed. He added that Germany's values and interests could not be secured internationally \"by Germany lecturing others with a raised index finger\".\nLindner said: \"It is not moral feelings of superiority in foreign policy that secure our influence. Our economic strength is also our geopolitical strength.\"\n\"Our country must move from left to center,\" Lindner said, adding that this election gives Germany such an opportunity.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock of the Green party spoke after Scholz's speech instead of Economy Minister Robert Habeck, who has been unable to attend the debate because of a problem with the Bundeswehr plane that was to bring him back from Lisbon.\nIn her speech, Baerbock emphasized Germany's strength and democratic principles despite insecurity in much of the rest of the world.\nShe stressed that she believed the German government under Scholz had taken responsibility for the problems the country does have, including in the field of energy supply, such as by weaning Germany off Russian gas amid Moscow's invasion of Ukraine.\nBaerbock also emphasized the need for a united Europe and strong Germany to face the challenges posed by the conflict in Ukraine and the climate crise.\nCDU leader Friedrich Merz accused Scholz of having rejected all his party's proposals to come to grips with illegal immigration.\nHe said any new government had to regain control over migration with expulsions at the border.\nMerz's Christian Democrats have been polling around 30% or more in the polls for a year now, while Scholz's Social Democrats, currently poll in third place with around 16%, behind the AfD, which is at around 19%.\nWhile the main campaign issue will likely be the country's economy, immigration is another topic on the mind of German voters.\nThe leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU), Friedrich Merz, slammed Scholz after his speech, accusing him of being the person to split the country.\nHe called Scholz's alleged delay of the vote of confidence necessary for new elections \"simply unacceptable\" and a speech last week by the chancellor as \"unworthy of the leader of Germany.\"\nMerz insisted that the Bundestag was still capable of taking action, despite Scholz's no longer possessing a majority.\nHe said Germany needed a government that did not argue among itself along with a completely different political approach.\nMerz also stressed that he would not work together with the far-right AfD party, no matter how strong it became at new elections.\nThe CDU has been leading nationwide surveys for some months now, with Merz seen widely as favorite to win the planned snap elections in February.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nScholz used his speech to call for more harmony in society, using the rifts made apparent by the recent US elections as a warning example.\nHe said he never wanted the degree of polarization in Germany to reach the same pitch.\nScholz said he had talked with US President-elect Donald Trump, stressing that US-Germany ties should remain good.\nScholz said he had a \"good conversation\" with Trump.\n\"We should do everything we can in the coming decades, regardless of who is in power here or there, to ensure that this relationship continues to develop well,\" Scholz said.\nScholz said that although he believed Europe had a responsibility to ensure Ukraine has a good future as the country fights against a Russian invasion, any support from Germany should not come at the cost of German prosperity.\nSupport for Ukraine must not lead to cuts in pensions or care, he said.\nAt the same time, Scholz vowed that Ukraine would \"not be left alone.\"\nHis remarks are possibly a response to calls by parties such as the AfD, the Left Party and the Alliance Sarah Wagenknecht to reduce or completely cut German military aid to Kyiv.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIf the February 23 date is confirmed by German President Steinmeier, this is what must happen before the elections take place:\n​​​​​​​\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider

held on December 16, which would pave the way for snap elections set for February.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5

    "content": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's book 'Freedom' caused a stir ahead of its official publication on November 26. There's also the question of what role it might play in Germany’s upcoming snap elections.\nAngela Merkel's book was launched with fanfare in the West but also in China. Tickets for Tuesday evening's initial presentation of the former German chancellor's 736-page opus at the Deutsches Theater in Berlin sold out online within minutes of going on sale a few weeks ago.\nMerkel's \"Freedom: Memoirs 1954-2021\" looks back on her life from her childhood and youth in former East Germany, German reunification, and her political rise through the end of her 16-year chancellorship in 2021. The book is being simultaneously published as an audiobook and in translation in several languages, including French and English. After that, the 70-year-old former leader is expected to embark on a tour of major European cities to promote the work.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn excerpts released ahead of publication and several high-profile newspaper interviews, Merkel reveals her thoughts on current events. For example, she details her experience with Donald Trump during his first term as US president, the difficulties of being the first female candidate for chancellor, and her decision to welcome almost large numbers of displaced people in 2015. She also explains her relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and her policies on Ukraine — which are now viewed somewhat skeptically by critics in Berlin.\nHer memoir is unexpectedly coinciding with Germany's federal election campaign following the collapse of the coalition government under her successor as chancellor, Olaf Scholz. According to Ralph Bollmann, a journalist and author of a Merkel biography, the election is likely to cast a long shadow over the reception of her book.\nSo, too, will other unexpected political developments internationally, such as Trump's reelection, Bollmann told DW. \"Back then,\" he said, referring to Trump's first term, \"she was downright celebrated in the US as his liberal-democratic opponent. This will certainly help her with marketing now.\"\nMerkel will be in Washington on December 2, when she is set to present her book in the United States alongside her friend and former US President Barack Obama.\nWithin Germany, Bollmann sees it as a \"miscalculation\" on the part of the Berlin establishment to think that Merkel is no longer popular in Germany because of what critics have called her conciliatory approach to Moscow. She still has \"many fans in the country\" and the book will sell well, Bollmann said.\nWhat will be more problematic than her foreign policy decisions, he said, will be her \"unwillingness to reform her domestic policy.\" For example, her reluctance to push ahead with difficult issues such as reforming the military or taking powerful climate change action.\n\"Everyone will simply quote what suits their agenda,\" Bollmann said. What is striking, however, as Germany faces an election, is how all the major candidates for chancellor are trying to appeal to Merkel voters in their own way.\nThe main draw of the book will be to glean Merkel's view of key people and events, political scientist and journalist Andreas Püttmann told DW. Never, he said, has \"so much broad criticism, retrospective known-it-all attitudes, and hatred been heaped on a top politician as much as Angela Merkel. This is precisely why it is so important for her to \"present things from her perspective to a broader public.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs usual with such projects, it remains unclear how much money the former chancellor is going to make from selling her story. Several German media outlets, without citing sources, have cited sums from 10 million to 12 million euros. No one from Merkel's team has commented on these conjectures.\nThe closest Merkel got to responding to these rumors was when she was referred to in an interview by Der Spiegel magazine as a soon-to-be \"multimillionaire\" and compared to Obama, who has capitalized on his former job to great success. She said that, like Obama, she hopes to establish a foundation.\n\"I won't be able to set up anything as big as Obama. But let's see,\" she said.\nThe choice of venue for her book launch is considered significant, as the Deutsches Theater is just a few minutes walk away from where Merkel resided in a divided Berlin. She and her husband, Joachim Sauer, are regular guests at the theater, considered one of the most sophisticated theaters in the city. A passage from her book quoted in Die Zeit magazine reads that she went to the theater once a year with her parents, including the Deutsches Theater. She writes of how these visits \"always remain in her memory.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "As Germany prepares for elections in February, concern has grown about the efforts of anti-democratic actors to sway public opinion through online manipulation. Tactics range from cyberattacks to AI propaganda.\nGermany is bracing for digital threats in the run-up to the general election.\nWith the country expected to elect a new parliament on February 23, authorities and researchers are raising concerns about the potential impact of hack-and-leak operations and disinformation campaigns aimed at swaying public opinion or sowing division ahead of the vote.\nIn a recent analysis, Germany's domestic intelligence agency warned of \"attempts by foreign states to exert influence.\"\nThis warning was echoed by Claudia Plattner, the president of Germany's cybersecurity agency, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), who told reporters that \"there are forces inside and outside Germany that have an interest in attacking the election process and disrupting the democratic order.\"\nThe snap election, held under a compressed timeline, not only poses logistical challenges for authorities — it also comes at a time of heightened political tensions.\n\"There are various issues, from the economy to the geopolitical situation, that are dividing society,\" Josef Lentsch, the CEO of the Political Tech Summit conference, which will take place in Berlin at the end of January, told DW.\n\"Populists and extremists are particularly good at exploiting these social divides,\" he said.\nCyberattacks on prominent individuals and organizations may pose a significant threat to the election, experts say. Once obtained, sensitive data can be used in coordinated \"hack-and-leak\" operations, in which stolen material — often altered or taken out of context — is released to undermine the credibility of political candidates or parties.\n\"Against the backdrop of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia probably has the greatest and most obvious interest in influencing the election in its own favor,\" Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), warned in late November.\nBut domestic actors operating from within Germany pose an equally significant risk to the integrity of the election, Lentsch said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"The public sphere has evolved,\" he said. \"Anti-democratic actors are now using channels on messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, as well as social media platforms like TikTok, to circumvent the filtering functions of traditional media and other trusted entities.\"\nBoth extremist fringe actors and parties such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have spent years building this \"alternative digital infrastructure,\" Lentsch said. \"As a result, they now have almost a decade's head start over other actors, such as the established parties.\"\n\nThe political firepower of this kind of digital infrastructure was demonstrated in the first round of Romania's presidential election, with the surprise victory of nationalist Calin Georgescu, a far-right admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nOn Friday, December 6, Romania's Constitutional Court annulled the results after President Klaus Iohannis had declassified security documents. The documents alleged that Russia had run a campaign involving thousands of social media accounts on platforms such as TikTok and Telegram to promote Georgescu.\n\"Romania is an EU country. What happened there can happen elsewhere, including in Germany,\" Lentsch said.\nIn Germany, no party has built a larger \"digital infrastructure\" to push its narratives than the AfD, Katja Munoz, a research fellow at the Center for Geopolitics, Geoeconomics and Technology at the Berlin-based think tank German Council on Foreign Relations, told DW.\nWithin this network, multiple social media accounts interact with each other to prompt the platforms' algorithms to amplify the reach of posts, Munoz said: \"It's an orchestrated move to push the same narrative.\"\nAt the same time, new so-called generative AI programs allow parties and individuals to create posts — from text to images and even video — much faster than before. Officials from across the political spectrum have begun using the technology to create illustrations for social media posts, for example.\nAnd yet \"in Germany, we see that the party that spreads by far the most AI-generated content is the AfD,\" Munoz said, referring to an analysis she conducted around the European elections, as well as regional elections in 2024.\n\"This content is not necessarily false, but it's misleading and meant to confirm existing beliefs — it's AI propaganda,\" she said, citing the example of a 78-second AI-generated video released by the AfD in September, just days before a regional election. The clip depicted scenarios in which people who were mostly blond and blue-eyed were contrasted with people of color, who were shown in negative contexts.\nA multipronged approach is needed to protect the integrity of Germany's campaign and election, experts say.\nTo counter cyberattacks, the BfV has formed a special task force to monitor threats. The cybersecurity agency BSI is offering online seminars to candidates and parties to help them secure their devices and online accounts against cyber intruders.\n\"Normally we would have liked to do this on site and in person, but now we have to switch to webinars simply because we don't have as much time to prepare as we thought,\" BSI President Plattner told the public broadcaster Deutschlandradio.\nWith only about two and a half months remaining until the expected elections, Lentsch said: \"It is all the more important that civil society, political actors and state authorities engage in dialogue, especially as the period leading up to the elections has shortened.\"\nMunoz said authorities should also step up efforts to raise awareness about disinformation and AI-generated propaganda: \"Officials should explain to people how public opinion is being manipulated and how fringe views are being pushed to the center of the debate.\"\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The BSW also performed strongly enough that it will likely become part of Saxony's coalition government.\nLater in September, the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), came out on top with 30.9% of the vote during the Brandenburg state election, but the AfD still had a strong second place showing at 29.2%.\nAnger over inflation, migration and lack of housing are some of the reasons why German voters are turning to populist parties. Voters who disagree with German arms deliveries to Ukraine have also been drawn to the  AfD and BSW, which are critical of Western military aid to Kyiv.\nMetsola, who belongs to the EU's center-right Christian Democratic EPP group, called on pro-European and pro-Ukraine parties in Germany to \"stand together on important future issues.\"\nMetsola also implored the German government to take a decisive stance on European affairs: \"A strong Europe needs a strong Germany. And a determined Franco-German alliance, also complemented by Poland and Italy.\"\nIn the interview, Metsola was asked if she supports the German government delivering Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Taurus missiles have a range of up to 500 kilometers (310 miles).\n\"Yes, that is also the position of the European Parliament. There is broad support for this demand. We will see if there is a corresponding policy change after the Bundestag elections,\" she said.\nThe leader of Germany's conservative opposition Christian Democratic Union, Friedrich Merz, has supported giving Taurus missiles to Ukraine. Merz has a strong chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor, as the CDU leads most opinion polls before the February vote.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe current coalition government, meanwhile, is helmed by SPD Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who opposes Taurus deliveries to Ukraine due to fears of escalating tensions with Russia. His coalition partners, the environmentalist Green Party, back the transfer of Taurus missiles to Ukraine.\nMetsola noted that there are \"differing positions\" within Germany's government on the Taurus deliveries, and said a U-turn on weapons by the German government could occur before the February 2025 election.\nMetsola's comments come after US President Joe Biden has greenlit the use of longer-range missiles by Ukraine.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter the announcement, Ukraine fired the weapons known as ATACMS into Russia, with Russian President Vladimir Putin then authorizing a new type of intermediate-range missile be used on Ukrainian soil in response.\nMaterial from German news agency DPA was used in the writing of this article"

    "content": "After Donald Trump's US election win and with an early federal election slated to take place in Germany on February 23, questions are being asked about what role social media could — and should — play in party campaigns.\nThe leaders of Germany's traditional parties are clearly nervous about the rise of populist parties.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured just over 30% of the vote in recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, which was partly attributed to the party's effectiveness at reaching first-time voters on TikTok.\nMatthias Kettemann, an expert on internet regulation and media law at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, argues that it its impossible to say exactly what impact social media has in shaping public opinion and democratic decision-making processes more broadly.\nHowever, what is clear is that more and more people are using social media and that there is a general trend toward polarization. \"The parties on the far right and far left tend to do much better on social media because they tend to have easier stories to tell, which in turn foster engagement together with the amplification algorithms of the platforms,\" Kettemann told DW.\nObservers are also wary of the growing influence of Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and CEO of the platform X, who was arguably Trump's greatest ally in his successful campaign to retake the US presidency.\nAfter Germany's ruling coalition government collapsed on November 6, Musk repeatedly referred to Germany's center-left leaders as \"fools.\"\nMeanwhile, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, of Germany's Green Party, this week made a surprise comeback to the microblogging platform following a six-year break, saying he did not think it was right to leave X to the \"loudmouths and populists.\"\n\"The most important problem is disinformation from the top,\" said Jörg Hassler, an expert in digital and political communication at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. He said political leaders now focus more on making personal attacks on their competitors or engage in debates on side issues like election dates.\nDuring a debate in the Bundestag on Wednesday, center-right Christian Democrat (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz expressed his disgust at AI-generated fake videos about him that had been circulating online and shared on social media. \"The fact that they are being posted and forwarded by Social Democrat lawmakers gives a taste of the kind of election campaign you are obviously prepared to run here in Germany,\" Merz said.\n\"The important issues are how well the economy does, whether people are able to get state welfare and so on, but it appears that politicians aren't interested in talking about those,\" said Kettemann.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile campaign tools developed in the US are subject to strict legal and regulatory limits in Germany, for example through data protection laws and laws around party financing, social media has become an important part of the hybrid media ecosystem, in which information loops between social media and traditional media outlets.\n\"You can't win elections on social media, but you can lose them,\" said Hassler. He pointed to the example of Armin Laschet, who ran as the CDU candidate for chancellor in the 2021 federal election. Laschet's campaign was effectively sunk after he was filmed laughing during a official visit to Rhein-Erft-Kreis, a region of Germany devastated by extreme flooding in July 2021. Outrage spread on X, then called Twitter, using the hashtag \"#laschetlacht\" (\"#laschetlaughs\").\nFor the first time in 2022, more German citizens said they mainly followed the news online rather than on television, as reported in the Reuters Institute annual survey for the Study of Journalism. According to the 2024 Media Study by German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF, only 7% of the German population uses X on a regular basis compared with Instagram (37%), Facebook (33%) and TikTok (18%).\nAnother important factor in the upcoming federal election, said Kettemann says, will be the role of foreign actors using disinformation operations, for example bot farms and \"dark campaigns\" on messaging apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp to push certain narratives. Germany's populist AfD and the  leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)have run on pro-Russia, socially conservative, anti-immigration and anti-climate protection platforms.\n\"We know for example that Russia much prefers certain political parties in Germany over others. They want to exacerbate the polarization tendencies within German society and that's a threat we should be keenly aware of in the run-up to the Bundestag election,\" said Hassler.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe EU has already introduced a comprehensive set of regulations for social media and digital marketplaces with the Digital Services Act (DSA) that aims to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, as well as the spread of disinformation.\nIn preliminary findings issued in July, EU regulators found X to be in breach of the DSA, stating that the blue check verification system \"deceives users,\" that the platform was not in compliance with \"required transparency on advertising\" and \"fails to provide access to its public data to researchers.\"\nThe challenge now will be to implement the legislation, said Kettemann, and that won't happen in time for the German federal election in February anyway. \"Some platforms like X don't seem to be cooperating whatsoever with the EU rules, so it will be quite challenging to bring that platform in line with democratic values and EU rules,\" he said.\nThis could be even more difficult in future because Musk's role is growing in US policy-making, Kettemann said, after US Vice President-elect JD Vance suggested this week that the US would withdraw support for NATO if the EU tried to regulate X.\nAs more and more voters, especially young voters, are informing themselves about politics and world affairs on social media, Ketterman urged traditional parties to step up their activities on social media platforms because they should not leave the field to disinformation actors.\n\"We have to fight the fight,\" he said.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seeking a vote of confidence, which he is expected to lose. Does such a move work as a path to restore political stability?\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is seeking a vote of confidence in the lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, which he is expected to lose, triggering an early general election.\nScholz's three-way center-left government broke apart on November 6, paving the way for an early federal election expected on February 23, 2025.\nEarly elections have been extremely rare in Germany, but they are a vital democratic measure. They are regulated by the German constitution and require the approval of several constitutional bodies, not least of the head of state, the president.\nAccording to the German constitution, a decision to hold an early federal election cannot be made by the members of the Bundestag, nor by the chancellor. An early dissolution of parliament can only come about in one of two ways.\nIn the first case, if a candidate for chancellor does not win an absolute parliamentary majority — at least 367 votes in the 733-seat Bundestag — the German president can dissolve the parliament. This has never happened in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the second case, a chancellor can call for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag to confirm whether he or she still has sufficient parliamentary support. If the chancellor fails to win a majority, he or she can formally ask the president to dissolve the Bundestag within 21 days.\nFollowing the dissolution of parliament, an election must be held within 60 days. They are organized in the same way as normal general elections, with the federal returning officer and the Federal Interior Ministry responsible for their implementation.\nThree early Bundestag elections have been held to date in the Federal Republic of Germany: in 1972, 1983 and 2005.\nWilly Brandt, the first chancellor from the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), governed in a coalition with the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) beginning in 1969. His \"Ostpolitik\" (politics toward the East) led to a vote of confidence in 1972.\nBrandt had pushed ahead with his policy of rapprochement during the Cold War to ease relations with the socialist Eastern European bloc, a highly controversial move in West Germany. Major splits emerged within the government, causing several SPD and FDP Bundestag lawmakers to quit. The government's majority was dramatically reduced, and Brandt's support fell to parity with the opposition conservatives, the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the regional Bavarian Christian Socialist Union (CSU): each side had 248 representatives in the Bundestag.\nThat stalemate paralyzed proceedings, so Brandt sought a solution. On June 24, 1972, he stated that \"the citizens\" had a \"right to ensure that legislation does not come to a standstill.\" He also said there was a growing danger \"that the opposition will fundamentally refuse to cooperate constructively. Therefore, I am announcing that we are seeking new elections.\"\nBrandt called for a vote of confidence in the Bundestag with the aim of losing it, so that his chancellorship could be reconfirmed by voters in fresh elections. This move was fiercely criticized, also by constitutional lawyers who argued that deliberately losing a vote of confidence was not consistent with the spirit of the constitution, the Basic Law.\nBrandt stuck to his plan and called a vote of confidence on September 20, 1972 — and lost, as he had planned. That set the path for the Bundestag's dissolution and a new election, which was held on November 19, 1972.\nBrandt was reelected as chancellor, and the SPD received 45.8% of the vote — its best result to date. Voter turnout was the highest ever for a Bundestag election, at 91.1%.\nHelmut Kohl, of the CDU, was responsible for the second early Bundestag election, in 1983. Kohl assumed power following a constructive vote of confidence in the then Chancellor Helmut Schmidt (SPD), in October 1982. The majority of parliamentarians had withdrawn their confidence in Schmidt due to differences over his economic and security policy.\nBecause Kohl's coalition of the CDU/CSU and FDP came to power through a vote of confidence and not a general election, Kohl wished for additional legitimacy through a general election. He called for a vote of confidence, which he, too, deliberately lost on December 17, 1982, resulting in the dissolution of the Bundestag. Kohl said at the time, \"I opened the way to new elections in order to stabilize the government and obtain a clear majority in the Bundestag.\"\nSome Bundestag members found that unacceptable and filed a complaint with the Federal Constitutional Court. After 41 days of hearings, the Karlsruhe judges approved Kohl's path to a new election by a deliberate vote of no confidence. However, they emphasized that a vote of confidence was only permissible during a \"genuine\" crisis.\nThe subsequent election held on March 6, 1983, confirmed Kohl as chancellor, and his government was able to carry on with a clear majority.\nThe SPD's Gerhard Schröder initiated Germany's third early election in 2005. He was chancellor at the time, heading a coalition with the Greens.\nThe SPD was struggling after a series of state election defeats and declining support in the Bundestag. The dwindling support was mostly due to Schröder's controversial Agenda 2010 reforms, which had drastically changed the social system and the labor market. Schröder called for a vote of confidence, which he deliberately lost on July 1, 2005, thus triggering a new election.\n\"I am firmly convinced that the majority of Germans want me to continue along this path. But I can only gain the necessary clarity only through a new election,\" Schröder said after the vote.\nBut his calculation went afoul. The early election, held on September 18, 2005, gave Angela Merkel's CDU/CSU a narrow majority. She became chancellor, heading a CDU/CSU-led coalition supported by the SPD. That was the start of 16 years in office for Merkel.\nThis article was originally written in German.

    "content": "Despite poor approval ratings, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will run again as the Social Democrats' top candidate in the 2025 federal elections. Why did the German government become so unpopular during his tenure?\nIn September, Olaf Scholz brushed aside a journalist's question about his legacy.\n\"I think you should be wary of politicians who think about that before their term in office has ended,\" he told Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper in response to the question of what he hoped would one day be written in the history books about his time in office.\nTwo months later, following the collapse of his center-left three-way coalition, he may be beginning to ponder that question. So far, the leadership of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is publicly demonstrating support for Scholz as their top candidate for the upcoming election on February 23, 2025. But with Scholz's low popularity ratings and the election campaign already heating up, calls in the party came up to replace Scholz with 64-year-old Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has been Germany's most popular politician in polls for months.\nIf, as predicted, the center-right bloc of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) takes over the chancellorship, Scholz will have had the shortest term of office of any of the four chancellors of the SPD in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nBut Scholz is determined to win. In view of the current polls, which show the SPD only half as strong as the CDU/CSU, this is will be a real challenge.\nHaving said that, Scholz has never lacked self-confidence. Even in seemingly hopeless situations, he has always fervently believed he had everything under control. Critics have accused him of having a distorted perception of reality in such moments.\n\"You obviously live in your own cosmos, in your own world,\" said CDU leader Friedrich Merz in response to Scholz's upbeat speech in parliament a week after his coalition collapsed. \"You have not understood what is happening out there in the country at the moment.\"\nScholz's political career has been marked by ups and downs. His chancellorship faced several major challenges following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Germany's tightrope walk of supporting Ukraine militarily without being drawn into the war itself.\nThe resulting energy crisis, inflation, the economic slump, the European asylum dispute and the unprecedented postwar electoral success of the far right — the federal government has had to deal with an extraordinary multitude of problems under Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHis coalition government, named the \"traffic light\" coalition after the three parties' colors — SPD (red), neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) (yellow) and environmentalist Greens — was an alliance full of political contradictions. It was a self-proclaimed \"progressive coalition\" formed after the 2021 general election, but the differences between party programs could not be bridged for long. After months of public bickering and backstabbing, it had become the most unpopular German government since the end of World War II.\nScholz, however, seems unfazed, pointing to the 2021 election campaign when he managed to buck the trend and win. Three months before the general election, victory for the SPD seemed impossible. The party was far behind in the polls, but Scholz was undeterred, saying again and again: \"I will become the chancellor.\"\nHis stoic optimism earned him much ridicule at the time, but one month before the vote, CDU candidate Armin Laschet made one mistake too many, and the SPD emerged the surprise winners garnering 25.7% of the vote, 1% ahead of the conservatives.\nFor Scholz, the 2021 win was the pinnacle of his decadeslong political career. He joined the SPD as a schoolboy in 1975. Before he entered the Bundestag in 1998, he ran his own law firm in Hamburg, held office as Hamburg's senator of the interior, as labor minister in the first \"grand coalition\" of the SPD and CDU/CSU under Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nThen he was governing mayor of the city-state of Hamburg for many years. \"Whoever orders leadership from me, gets it,\" he famously said when he took office there in 2011. In 2018, he moved back to Berlin as finance minister in another grand coalition under Merkel.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Scholz served as SPD secretary general alongside Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. It was during this time that the Hamburg weekly newspaper Die Zeit coined a phrase that stuck: \"Scholzomat\" — combining \"Scholz\" and \"Automat\" to reflect Scholz's dispassionate manner and technocratic language, like a machine whose job it is to unflinchingly sell government policy, showing no emotion.\nIn the years since, Scholz has been unable to shake off the image of the boring and fun-free bureaucrat. He sees himself as a fact-oriented pragmatist who, rather than putting on a show, only says as much as is absolutely necessary, while working quietly and efficiently.\nThat strategy worked well for him during his time as finance minister, when he quickly provided billions in aid to companies affected by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, he has failed to realize that the job of chancellor requires far more communication. Scholz has remained silent during the biggest of crises, rarely finding the right words, seeming arrogant and failing to win the hearts and minds of the people. But even though many supporters have called on him to change his style — to talk more, to become more approachable and even show some emotion — Scholz has refused to adapt, simply letting criticism roll off his back.\nEven though the SPD executive is currently demonstratively in favor of Scholz as the top candidate, he has not yet been nominated. The official nomination of a top candidate is scheduled to happen at a party conference in January.\nThis article was originally written in German. It was first published on November 15, 2024, and then updated when Boris Pistorius made clear that he is not competing with Scholz for the chancellorship.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

For example, she details her experience with Donald Trump during his first term as US president, the difficulties of being the first female candidate for chancellor, and her decision to welcome almost large numbers of displaced people in 2015. She also explains her relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and her policies on Ukraine — which are now viewed somewhat skeptically by critics in Berlin.\nHer memoir is unexpectedly coinciding with Germany's federal election campaign following the collapse of the coalition government under her successor as chancellor, Olaf Scholz. According to Ralph Bollmann, a journalist and author of a Merkel biography, the election is likely to cast a long shadow over the reception of her book.\nSo, too, will other unexpected political developments internationally, such as Trump's reelection, Bollmann told DW. \"Back then,\" he said, referring to Trump's first term, \"she was downright celebrated in the US as his liberal-democratic opponent. This will certainly help her with marketing now.\"\nMerkel will be in Washington on December 2, when she is set to present her book in the United States alongside her friend and former US President Barack Obama.\nWithin Germany, Bollmann sees it as a \"miscalculation\" on the part of the Berlin establishment to think that Merkel is no longer popular in Germany because of what critics have called her conciliatory approach to Moscow. She still has \"many fans in the country\" and the book will sell well, Bollmann said.\nWhat will be more problematic than her foreign policy decisions, he said, will be her \"unwillingness to reform her domestic policy.\" For example, her reluctance to push ahead with difficult issues such as reforming the military or taking powerful climate change action.\n\"Everyone will simply quote what suits their agenda,\" Bollmann said. What is striking, however, as Germany faces an election, is how all the major candidates for chancellor are trying to appeal to Merkel voters in their own way.\nThe main draw of the book will be to glean Merkel's view of key people and events, political scientist and journalist Andreas Püttmann told DW. Never, he said, has \"so much broad criticism, retrospective known-it-all attitudes, and hatred been heaped on a top politician as much as Angela Merkel. This is precisely why it is so important for her to \"present things from her perspective to a broader public.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs usual with such projects, it remains unclear how much money the former chancellor is going to make from selling her story. Several German media outlets, without citing sources, have cited sums from 10 million to 12 million euros. No one from Merkel's team has commented on these conjectures.\nThe closest Merkel got to responding to these rumors was when she was referred to in an interview by Der Spiegel magazine as a soon-to-be \"multimillionaire\" and compared to Obama, who has capitalized on his former job to great success. She said that, like Obama, she hopes to establish a foundation.\n\"I won't be able to set up anything as big as Obama. But let's see,\" she said.\nThe choice of venue for her book launch is considered significant, as the Deutsches Theater is just a few minutes walk away from where Merkel resided in a divided Berlin. She and her husband, Joachim Sauer, are regular guests at the theater, considered one of the most sophisticated theaters in the city. A passage from her book quoted in Die Zeit magazine reads that she went to the theater once a year with her parents, including the Deutsches Theater. She writes of how these visits \"always remain in her memory.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz told the Bundestag that the snap election campaign shouldn't cause \"stagnation.\" He urged opposition parties to support his coalition's final plans before February’s vote.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz faced a question-and-answer session lasting about an hour in the Bundestag on Wednesday, just weeks before he's expected to call a vote of confidence in his minority government to pave the way towards snap elections.\nHe appealed to opposition politicians to consider supporting last pieces of legislation his outgoing government still hopes to pass prior to the vote.\n\"The time of the election campaign is not a time of stagnation,\" Scholz appealed to the chamber. \"We can still get things done. I am asking you to contribute.\"\nScholz explicitly mentioned three pieces of legislation that he said would be in everyone's interest to agree on, whatever happens in the vote expected late in February.\nAll of them, he said, would contribute to \"easing the burden on citizens\" financially.\nScholz first cited moving tax brackets to avoid what's sometimes known as \"bracket creep,\" or \"cold progression\" in German — when inflation and resultant pay increases lead to people entering a higher tax bracket despite little or no discernible changes to their living standards.\nHe said that child welfare payments also needed adjusting.\nScholz also called for lawmakers to approve plans for continuing the discounted €58 (roughly $61) flat-fare monthly nationwide rail pass known as the \"Deutschlandticket.\"\nThe chancellor greeted leading CDU politicians Friedrich Merz, the candidate for chancellor, and Armin Laschet, the 2021 candidate, in the chamber ahead of the session. But the largest opposition party did not directly respond to or challenge his calls for support for passing legislation.\nScholz also spoke on Ukraine, following his trip to Kyiv on Monday and talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nScholz said he'd told Zelenskyy that Ukraine could be assured of continued German support, but also said his goal was \"to develop concepts with Ukraine on how the war could one day end after all.\"\nHe said it was crucial that such discussions involved the government in Kyiv and that decisions were not made \"over Ukraine's head.\"\nScholz also tried to defend the more cautious parts of his approach to the conflict, like not providing longer-range Taurus missiles, saying that he would \"continue to do everything so that it doesn't come to a further escalation,\" particularly a conflict between Russia and NATO.\nScholz said that the Taurus was a \"very, very far-reaching weapon\" with high precision and potential for damage.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe chancellor said Zelenskyy had also asked him to do more to ensure that Ukrainians who fled to Germany after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion find work.\nZelenskyy wanted to set up a Ukrainian authority for countries like Germany and Poland that would support people to this end, Scholz told the chamber.\n\"Many have been here for a long time now and really should be getting started,\" he said.\n'I also want to be my own successor'\nWednesday's session was the first monthly Q&A with the chancellor, a concept loosely modeled on Prime Ministers' Questions in the UK and introduced around a decade ago, since Scholz confirmed he would be triggering early elections in February and the SPD confirmed Scholz would again be their lead candidate.\nThis followed him firing Free Democrat (FDP) Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the withdrawal of FDP support for his formerly three-party coalition, also including his Social Democrats and the Greens.\nSpeaking of his ambitions in the aftermath of the vote, Scholz repeated what appears a bold goal for the SPD as they languish in third place in most nationwide polls.\n\"I also want to be my own successor,\" Scholz said, as the party hopes for a late rebound in support akin to the one it enjoyed in 2021's national election campaign.\nPolls currently put the CDU/CSU on more than 30% support, more than double the roughly 15% enjoyed by the SPD, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on around 19%.\nThe SPD has never finished outside the top two in a post-war German election.\nmsh/ab (AFP, dpa, epd)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

He told President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that everything must be done to allow Ukraine to fully exercise its right to self-defense.\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of Germany's center-right Christian Democrats (CDU), arrived in the Ukrainiancapital of Kyiv early on Monday.\nThe conservative candidate for chancellor in the country's upcoming snap elections was visiting the country for the second time since the Russian invasion began in 2022.\nMerz said he wanted to use the visit to inform himself \"of the present condition of the defense of this country\" and assure it of Germany's continued backing.\nArriving by train from Poland, he said he wanted to \"help this battered country to continue to defend itself against Russian aggression.\"\nThe conservative leader said in a post on X, \"the war in Ukraine must end as soon as possible. Only if Ukraine can defend itself will Putin enter into negotiations.\"\nLater on Monday, Merz met with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n\"We want your army to be capable of hitting military bases in Russia. Not the civilian population, not infrastructure, but the military targets from which your country is being attacked,\" Merz told the president. He added that restrictions many Western allies had placed on Ukraine's ability to use their weapons was \"akin to forcing your country to fight with one hand tied behind your back.\"\n\"We must do everything we can to enable Ukraine to exercise its right to self-defence without restriction. And do everything we can to end this war as quickly as possible,\" Merz said at a meeting with Zelenskyy.\nMerz again indicated that he would be far more open to supplying Ukraine with Germany's long-range Taurus cruise missiles. He said that Zelenskyy \"knows our position on the Taurus. Nothing has changed in this regard.\"\nAt the same joint press conference, Zelenskyy floated the idea of foreign troops fighting on behalf of Ukraine until his country gained NATO membership.\n\"A troop contingent from one country or another could be present in Ukraine for as long as it isn't part of NATO. But for that we need to have a clear understanding of when Ukraine becomes an EU member and when a NATO member,\" Zelenskyy said.\nThe Ukrainian leader also stressed to Merz the importance of European security guarantees in any potential negotiations with Russia to end Russia the war. Ukraine needs security guarantees not only from NATO, but also directly from European countries, Zelensky said\nMerz's visit to show support comes at a time when the future of the war is increasingly uncertain. It is not yet known if US President-elect Donald Trump will continue to provide Ukraine with aid, and Ukrainian forces have been losing territory along the Russian border.\nRussia has also stepped up drone strikes on energy infrastructure as winter temperatures start to drop across Ukraine.\nMerz said Ukraine's allies in Europe must be prepared for any eventualities, and key powers like Germany, France and the United Kingdom \"can only develop this strategy together.\" Zelensky also suggested that Denmark could play an important role.\nMeanwhile, the presidential spokesman said that Ukraine plans to call a meeting of its key European allies in December to coordinate a joint position and make sure that Kyiv is in a strong position on the battlefield and in any potential talks.\nGermany is the second-largest supplier of military equipment to Ukraine after the United States. So far, Chancellor Olaf Scholz has refused to send Kyiv the longer-range Taurus missiles it has repeatedly asked for. Merz has said that if he is elected in February, he will reverse that decision.\nes,dh/rm,rc (AFP, dpa)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Deutsche Bahn is investing big in addressing public perceptions of the German national rail carrier as hugely dysfunctional. But political disarray in Berlin has knocked it off track.\nTyler Bosselman was wearing the dark blue vest and the red tie of a Deutsche Bahntrain driver. As he sat comfortably in the operator's seat of his regional DB train, the landscapes of southern Germany rushed by outside, reflected in his sunglasses.\nConstruction is underway on one of the routes that the 24-year-old Bosselman drives. It's the busy Riedbahn route between Frankfurt and Mannheim in Germany, which is getting new switches and signals to make rail traffic run more smoothly. The goal is to finish the overhaul by the end of December, and Bosselman hopes that the upgrade will make Deutsche Bahn \"more reliable overall.\"\nReconstruction of the Riedbahn route marks the beginning of what Germany's state-owned railway operator touted as a reboot of the company, with routes to Hanover, Hamburg and other busy sections of its nationwide network set to follow soon.\nDB's so-called comprehensive reconstruction plan involves a total of 40 major construction projects and aims to ensure that the operator's infamously unpunctual trains will be running on time again by the end of the decade. At the program's launch this summer, German Transportation Minister Volker Wissing called it Germany's \"largest reconstruction and modernization program in recent decades.\"\nDB's plans could soon come to a screeching halt. The collapse of the three-party German government coalition on November 6, and fresh elections to be held on February 23 next year at the earliest, mean the country is stuck in political limbo for half a year, and so is funding for the rail program.\nMartin Burkert, chairman of the EVG rail workers union, has already warned that, without a 2025 national budget, there would be a lack of money to carry on with the projects. \"Years of planning work to finally get the infrastructure up to date and improve the punctuality and capacity of the network is now at risk,\" Burkert told the German news agency, dpa, recently.\nBosselman knows all too well how necessary the overhaul of DB's rail network is. Every day, the train driver navigates his engine through a web of construction sites in and around the Frankfurt rail hub. \"It's like when you are going to a casino. It's like you're gambling and hoping that you are on time. During rush hours, there is absolutely no guarantee that you are getting there in any reasonable time,\" Bosselman told DW.\nAn active union member, Bosselman can share many stories about what goes wrong at DB. While most regional trains still manage to be fairly punctual, he says, almost one in three long-distance trains in Germany now arrives late. Yet they are usually given priority on the crowded tracks thus holding up slower trains or idling them on sidetracks until they pass by. \"It doesn't matter if it is on a Monday, a Wednesday or any other day in the week. You can basically mark the day in your calendar that you make it into Frankfurt central station without having to slow down once.\"\nDB's infrastructure backlog is not only evident in the carrier's lack of punctuality, but has also increasingly manifested itself in a thinned-out network that has been shrinking for years. Surprisingly, this has happened against the backdrop of rising demand for its services, with goods volumes and passenger numbers having increased at the same time.\nBosselman said you could see the ruins left by a chronically underfunded rail company every day. As we pass a steel bridge, he points to rusty, moss-covered tracks nearby, which he says have been disused for a long time. \"You could have a much higher volume of traffic here, if you invested a few euros into this replacement track.\"\nAt the end of the 1990s, Germany was hit by a severe economic crisis, with the government cutting spending wherever possible. Deutsche Bahn, which is fully owned by the state, became an easy target for the cuts leading to a dramatic decline of investment in rail infrastructure.\nAlthough this has changed in recent years, the government still spends comparatively little money on Germany's railway infrastructure. According to the Pro-Rail Alliance — a lobby group that unites nonprofit pro-rail campaigners with railway sector companies — Germany spends about €115 ($121) per capita on its railways annually, while countries such as Austria or Switzerland invest three to four times as much.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Federal Court of Auditors — an independent body that audits the federal budget and oversees the management of public funds — highlighted the years of neglect and current underfunding in a recent report. It declared Deutsche Bahn a \"case for restructuring,\" and lambasted the government for having \"failed to address key rail policy questions for three decades.\"\nThe comprehensive reconstruction plan was supposed to be the answer to many of DB's woes, with the government earmarking €30 billion-€50 billion for the endeavor over the next three years. But now, after the collapse of the government, Germany has no budget for the next year which could threaten the funding for some of the rail projects.\nChristian Böttger, a professor at the Berlin University of Applied Sciences for Technology and Economics whose research areas include railroads, said he believed that DB would get the money one day, but only after a new government has been formed. \"A cancellation by a new government seems politically very unlikely to me, but even the already imminent postponement of construction projects is, of course, a disaster,\" he told DW.\nBosselman is not too worried about deep cuts to railway funding in the future. He said politicians had realized that DB is part of Germany's \"critical infrastructure.\" However, he believes that the current budget shortfalls will come at the expense of DB's reboot. \"In Germany, roads have always taken precedence over rail, and that's why I feel that cuts to rail are more likely.\"\nBosselman intends to stay positive, as he believes that there's already \"a lot of negativity going around\" in German politics. \"If you kind of give in to all that negativity, your life won't be too positive down the road,\" he said. \"I can't see myself sad or disappointed in everything,\" he added. \"There is always something to look up for.\"\nSo, instead of complaining about his employer, he aims to boost his career at the end of the year with a master's degree in railway operations, which, he said, could be a \"door-opener to a leadership role\" so that he can try to \"transform Deutsche Bahn from the inside.\"\nAnd some German passengers, though small in numbers, also have a reason for hope regarding improvements in rail services. DB announced a few weeks ago that the reconstruction of the Riedbahn would soon be completed, with service on the route scheduled to resume by mid-December — surprisingly for the rail operator, this would be right on schedule and just in time to complete the first project of the reconstruction plan ahead of the country's fresh elections.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nEditor's note: An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that the German ruling coalition collapsed on November 4. It has been corrected to state that the coalition collapsed on November 6.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Despite poor approval ratings, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will run again as the Social Democrats' top candidate in the 2025 federal elections. Why did the German government become so unpopular during his tenure?\nIn September, Olaf Scholz brushed aside a journalist's question about his legacy.\n\"I think you should be wary of politicians who think about that before their term in office has ended,\" he told Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper in response to the question of what he hoped would one day be written in the history books about his time in office.\nTwo months later, following the collapse of his center-left three-way coalition, he may be beginning to ponder that question. So far, the leadership of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is publicly demonstrating support for Scholz as their top candidate for the upcoming election on February 23, 2025. But with Scholz's low popularity ratings and the election campaign already heating up, calls in the party came up to replace Scholz with 64-year-old Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has been Germany's most popular politician in polls for months.\nIf, as predicted, the center-right bloc of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) takes over the chancellorship, Scholz will have had the shortest term of office of any of the four chancellors of the SPD in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nBut Scholz is determined to win. In view of the current polls, which show the SPD only half as strong as the CDU/CSU, this is will be a real challenge.\nHaving said that, Scholz has never lacked self-confidence. Even in seemingly hopeless situations, he has always fervently believed he had everything under control. Critics have accused him of having a distorted perception of reality in such moments.\n\"You obviously live in your own cosmos, in your own world,\" said CDU leader Friedrich Merz in response to Scholz's upbeat speech in parliament a week after his coalition collapsed. \"You have not understood what is happening out there in the country at the moment.\"\nScholz's political career has been marked by ups and downs. His chancellorship faced several major challenges following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Germany's tightrope walk of supporting Ukraine militarily without being drawn into the war itself.\nThe resulting energy crisis, inflation, the economic slump, the European asylum dispute and the unprecedented postwar electoral success of the far right — the federal government has had to deal with an extraordinary multitude of problems under Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHis coalition government, named the \"traffic light\" coalition after the three parties' colors — SPD (red), neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) (yellow) and environmentalist Greens — was an alliance full of political contradictions. It was a self-proclaimed \"progressive coalition\" formed after the 2021 general election, but the differences between party programs could not be bridged for long. After months of public bickering and backstabbing, it had become the most unpopular German government since the end of World War II.\nScholz, however, seems unfazed, pointing to the 2021 election campaign when he managed to buck the trend and win. Three months before the general election, victory for the SPD seemed impossible. The party was far behind in the polls, but Scholz was undeterred, saying again and again: \"I will become the chancellor.\"\nHis stoic optimism earned him much ridicule at the time, but one month before the vote, CDU candidate Armin Laschet made one mistake too many, and the SPD emerged the surprise winners garnering 25.7% of the vote, 1% ahead of the conservatives.\nFor Scholz, the 2021 win was the pinnacle of his decadeslong political career. He joined the SPD as a schoolboy in 1975. Before he entered the Bundestag in 1998, he ran his own law firm in Hamburg, held office as Hamburg's senator of the interior, as labor minister in the first \"grand coalition\" of the SPD and CDU/CSU under Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nThen he was governing mayor of the city-state of Hamburg for many years. \"Whoever orders leadership from me, gets it,\" he famously said when he took office there in 2011. In 2018, he moved back to Berlin as finance minister in another grand coalition under Merkel.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Scholz served as SPD secretary general alongside Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. It was during this time that the Hamburg weekly newspaper Die Zeit coined a phrase that stuck: \"Scholzomat\" — combining \"Scholz\" and \"Automat\" to reflect Scholz's dispassionate manner and technocratic language, like a machine whose job it is to unflinchingly sell government policy, showing no emotion.\nIn the years since, Scholz has been unable to shake off the image of the boring and fun-free bureaucrat. He sees himself as a fact-oriented pragmatist who, rather than putting on a show, only says as much as is absolutely necessary, while working quietly and efficiently.\nThat strategy worked well for him during his time as finance minister, when he quickly provided billions in aid to companies affected by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, he has failed to realize that the job of chancellor requires far more communication. Scholz has remained silent during the biggest of crises, rarely finding the right words, seeming arrogant and failing to win the hearts and minds of the people. But even though many supporters have called on him to change his style — to talk more, to become more approachable and even show some emotion — Scholz has refused to adapt, simply letting criticism roll off his back.\nEven though the SPD executive is currently demonstratively in favor of Scholz as the top candidate, he has not yet been nominated. The official nomination of a top candidate is scheduled to happen at a party conference in January.\nThis article was originally written in German. It was first published on November 15, 2024, and then updated when Boris Pistorius made clear that he is not competing with Scholz for the chancellorship.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "The German economy is in the doldrums, but the DAX, its blue-chip stock index, is on a streak of record highs. So why are German stocks doing much better than sentiment on the ground?\nGermany's benchmark blue-chip stock index topped 20,000 points for the first time during trading on Tuesday morning, hitting the historic mark shortly after opening.\nThe DAX, which is made up of 40 large publicly traded German corporations, has been hovering around the 19,000 mark recently but has surged towards 20,000 over the past week despite a continuing raft of grim data about the German economy overall.\nThe trend is a rare piece of positive news out of Europe's biggest economy as of late. Germany narrowly avoided recession for the third quarter of the year, but the latest data suggests a winter recession is inevitable in the new year. Added to that is bad news on the jobs front, with a wave of industrial job cuts recently announced at iconic firms such as Thyssenkrupp and Bosch.\nThen there's the serious struggles at carmaker Volkswagen, where job losses and plant closures have been in the offing for months.\nInfighting in the country's three-party ruling coalition over how to deal with the country's severe economic malaise led to the collapse of the government recently, with snap elections slated for February.\nLike elsewhere, Germany has been plagued by high inflation in recent years, leaving consumers strapped for cash. Industrial orders and production in the export nation have also fallen, and surveys show German companies are increasingly pessimistic about the future.\n\"Looking ahead, there is very little reason to expect any imminent change for the economy,\" Carsten Brzeski at ING Bank said last week. \"In fact, the expected economic policies of the incoming US administration as well as continued policy uncertainty as a result of the German government’s collapse are likely to weigh on sentiment in Germany.\"\nSo why the investor optimism?\n\"Ironically, I think there's a strong argument to make for an inverse correlation between economic performance and stock market performance,\" Ben Ritchie, head of developed market equities at investment company abrdn, told DW earlier this year, when the DAX also broke new ground despite weak overall economic data.\n\"The revenues for these companies aren't in Germany,\" Ritchie said. \"So the German economy doesn't matter.\"\nRetail customers and production sites for these large, international companies are primarily located outside of Germany. Experts such as Ritchie say the health of those markets, along with structural developments within specific industries and companies, has a far greater influence on DAX performance than the domestic economy does.\nHowever many argue that this is not the case for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Germany, which employ over 50% of the country's workforce but aren't represented in the DAX index.\nAs a result, their fortunes are much more tied to the domestic economy and its problems with rising costs and other structural challenges.\nIt's one of the reasons why business morale fell more than expected in Germany according to a survey released on November 25 by the country's Ifo Institute. \"The reading confirms that the German economy remains in the doldrums,\" Franziska Palmas, senior Europe economist at Capital Economics, said about the business sentiment figure.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe strength of the US economy is probably more significant to the DAX's current streak than Germany's. High coronavirus relief spending and low energy costs there have helped boost consumer spending over the past 18 months.\nHowever that has not been mirrored in Germany where consumer spending remains moribund, despite a significant cooling of inflation.\nYet some experts have suggested a sluggish domestic economy could ultimately be a good thing for stocks.\nFor Germany's largest companies, a weak German economy can lead to a cheaper euro as well as lower borrowing costs as the ECB tries to stimulate spending in Europe — which it is currently trying to do with a series of interest rate cuts. At the same time, stagnation would have little impact on revenues due to their large overseas markets.\nEdited by: Arthur Sullivan\nEditor's note: The article, originally published on February 29, 2024, was updated on December 3, 2024 to reflect that the German DAX has breached the 20,000 mark."

    "content": "Putin is visiting Belarus to sign a treaty offering security guarantees to Moscow's closest ally. Russian forces say they have captured two key villages in eastern Ukraine. DW has the latest.\nHere are the latest developments in Russia’s war in Ukraine on Friday, December 6.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz is confident he will be able to agree with US President-elect Donald Trump on a joint strategy for Ukraine after speaking to him on the phone, Scholz told the Funke group of newspapers.\n\"I have already spoken extensively on the phone with the future US president, and we are also in direct contact with those responsible for security policy,\" Scholz said in an interview published on Saturday morning.\n\"I am confident that we can develop a joint strategy for Ukraine. My guiding principle remains that nothing can be decided without giving the Ukrainian people a say,\" he stressed.\nGermany has been one of the Kyiv's biggest military backers, second only to the United States in terms of the aid sent to Ukraine.\nUS policy on Ukraine, which has been closely coordinated with European allies, is expected to change under Trump. The president-elect has vowed to push for a quick deal to end Russia's war, but has offered no details on how he would do so.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said his country could deploy its newly developed hypersonic Oreshnik missiles in Belarus next year.\n\"As for the possibility of deploying, to put it bluntly, such formidable weapons as Oreshnik on Belarusian territory... it will become possible, I think, in the second half of next year,\" Putin said in a televised meeting with Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko in Minsk.\nThe Russian president said this would happen as \"serial production\" of the missile is \"ramped up in Russia.\"\nThe Oreshnik nuclear-capable missile was revealed last month when it was used to strike the city of Dnipro in central Ukraine, a move that sharply escalated tensions in the war in Ukraine.\nIt is said to be capable of flying at 10 times the speed of sound and may be able to strike targets up to 5,500 kilometers (3,400 miles) away.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Russian economy is showing \"significant\" signs of a slowdown in some sectors, German Gref, the CEO of state-run Sberbank, was quoted as saying by Russian news agencies at an investor forum.\nInflation in the country is running high and the value of the Russian currency, the ruble, has slumped in recent months. The central bank, meanwhile, has raised interest rates to a two-decade high of 21%.\n\"We are now seeing significant signals of economic slowdown, particularly in housing construction and investment,\" Graf said.\nHe warned the central bank against \"overshooting\" on its rates policy, making it \"harder to return to the rails of economic growth.”\nRussia has massively ramped up military spending since it launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine over two-and-a-half years ago.\nThe spending boost has supported the economy, which has been hit hard by Western sanctions on Moscow.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRomania's far-right, pro-Kremlin presidential candidate, Calin Georgescu, has vowed to stop providing aid to Ukraine if he wins the presidential vote.  The run-off vote against the conservative-liberal reform politician Elena Lasconi was originally due this weekend but the nation's top court annulled it on Friday.\nThe court said the whole election process must be rerun, after the declassification of security documents.\nGeorgescu made the comments on Ukraine aid during an interview with the BBC.\nWhen asked whether Romania, under his leadership, would continue to provide military and political support to neighboring Ukraine, he said, \"No.\"\nHe added: \"Zero. Everything stops. I have to take care just about my people. We have a lot of problems ourselves.\"\nIn Romania, the president determines the guidelines for foreign and security policy.\nThe country is a member of NATO and the EU. It has so far firmly sided with Kyiv in its fight against Moscow's invasion.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSweden and Denmark have signed a contract with a Swedish military equipment manufacturer for the purchase of 205 armored combat vehicles.\nOf the 205 CV90 vehicles ordered, 115 will be delivered to Denmark, 50 to Sweden and 40 to Ukraine, the Swedish government said in a statement on Friday.\nThe contract with BAE Systems Hagglunds is worth 25 billion Swedish kronor ($2.3 billion, €2.17 billion).\n\"These investments will make it possible for more Swedish combat vehicles to make Europe, and especially Ukraine, safer,\" Swedish Defense Minister Pal Jonson said in the statement.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRussian oil is once again flowing to the Czech Republic via the Druzhba pipeline, authorities said on Friday.\nDeliveries via the pipeline resumed on Friday morning, Mariusz Wnuk, director of the company Orlen Unipetrol, wrote on the social media platform X.\nOn Wednesday, the Czech government said oil supply through the southern branch of the Druzhba pipeline had stopped. It did not provide any information on the possible reasons.\nThe Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary have been allowed temporary exemptions from the EU sanctions banning the import of Russian oil.\nLast year, the Druzhba pipeline provided about 58% of the oil consumed in the Czech Republic.\nThe country is currently investing in the expansion of the Transalpine Oil Pipeline (TAL) — which runs from the port of Trieste in Italy to Central Europe — to end its reliance on Russian oil.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGerman lawmakers are debating on Friday on whether to send Taurus long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine.\nChancellor Olaf Scholz has so far rejected delivering them to Kyiv despite repeated appeals from the Ukrainian government as well as some German politicians.\nHe argues that Germany runs the risk of being drawn into the war between Russia and Ukraine if the Taurus cruise missiles are used.\nThe Taurus is one of the most powerful weapons in the German army's arsenal, with the ability to penetrate bunkers.\nIt has a range of 500 kilometers (300 miles) and can be fired by a fighter jet.\nUkraine wants to use it to attack positions inside Russia.\nThe motion to discuss the Taurus delivery was submitted by the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP), which was until recently part of Scholz's governing coalition. The motion is unlikely to be voted on.\nThe collapse of the coalition last month triggered new elections, which are scheduled to take place in February next year.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRussia said Friday it had captured two key villages in eastern Ukraine, where its troops have been advancing for months.\nOne village, Sukhi Yaly, is about 13 kilometers (8 miles) southwest of Kurakhove, a strategic industrial town on the banks of a reservoir that Moscow is trying to encircle.\nThe other one is Pustynka, which lies just south of Pokrovsk, an embattled logistics hub key to supplying Ukrainian troops across the front line.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin is in Belarus to sign a treaty offering security guarantees to Moscow's closest ally.\nSpeaking alongside Belarus' President Alexander Lukashenko, Putin said: \"I'm sure that the treaty will ensure the security of Russia and Belarus.\"\nThe planned signing follows changes to Russia's nuclear doctrine, which lowered the threshold for Moscow’s use of its nuclear weaponswhile also extending Russia's nuclear umbrella to cover Belarus.\nPutin said on Friday that the new treaty document includes a potential use of Russian tactical nuclear weapons deployed to Belarus in response to an aggression.\nLukashenko, who has ruled Belarus with an iron fist since 1994, said in October that any use of Russian nuclear weapons now deployed in Belarus would require his personal assent.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nsri/ab (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)"

    "content": "Germany will not follow the United States in delivering long-range cruise missiles to Ukraine, Chancellor Olaf Scholz says. Officials fear that they could be used against targets within Russia.\nThe Taurus cruise missile is one of the most powerful weapons in the German army's arsenal, and has been at the top of Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's wish list for a long time. However, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, of the Social Democrats (SPD), continues to reject exports of the weapon to Ukraine.\nWith a warhead that can penetrate bunkers, the Taurus cruise missile has a range of 500 kilometers (300 miles) and can be fired by a fighter jet. Ukraine wants to use it to attack positions inside Russia from which President Vladimir Putin's military is bombing Ukraine. Russian rocket fire on cities in Ukraine has recently increased again.\nThe debate was reignited in Germany again after US President Joe Biden — just two months before the end of his term in office — reportedly decided to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles produced in the United States against targets in Russia. Biden is said to have changed his mind partly because Russia has persuaded North Korea to send thousands of soldiers to fight in the war.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn view of Ukraine's precarious military situation, more and more people are now calling for Germany to deliver Taurus missiles to Ukraine. However, these can fly significantly further than the American ATACMS missiles, which Ukraine may now use for the first time in the next few days to attack targets in Russia.\nThere has been a renewed push for such deliveries from the Free Democratic Party (FDP), which two weeks ago triggered new elections by leaving Scholz's coalition. The party wants to take this to the Bundestag: It is considering putting a motion to parliament for a vote before the early federal election on February 23.\nOne of the most vehement German supporters of the Taurus delivery is Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the European Parliament for the FDP. Referring to Biden's decision, she wrote on the social media platform X: \"I hope that Chancellor Olaf Scholz will have the same belated realization at the end of his term of office in the interest of Europe's security. If he is true to his word that he will act together with his allies, then he must finally act now.\"\nThe conservative Christian Democratic Union (CDU), the largest opposition party in the Bundestag, also supports the delivery of Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine. There is also approval from the Greens, the only remaining coalition partner of the SPD: Robert Habeck, economy minister and his party's chancellor candidate, said he would deliver Taurus cruise missiles to Ukraine if he were leading the government.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock, a fellow Green, also reacted positively to reports that Biden is allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles against specific targets in Russia, which she said would allow Ukraine to potentially destroy military launch bases from which it is being attacked. Some places in Ukraine are so close to the Russian border that air defense is of no help, the foreign minister said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSo far, the government has only allowed Ukraine to use German weapons in the Russian territories bordering the city of Kharkiv, which has repeatedly come under heavy fire from the Russian side.\nThough there are many voices in favor of delivering the Taurus, Scholz remains categorically opposed to delivering the weapon system. He argues that Germany runs the risk of being drawn into the war between Russia and Ukraine if the Taurus cruise missiles are used. \"We must not be linked in any way or at any place with the targets that this system achieves,\" he said.\nScholz sees no reason to reconsider this position, his spokesman said on Monday, reaffirming what the chancellor said in his government declaration Wednesday. Scholz continues to receive backing for his course from his party. The delivery of Taurus is out of the question, said SPD leader Saskia Esken: \"We will stick to that.\"\nIn March, the CDU parliamentary group brought a motion calling for the deliveries before the Bundestag. At the time, the parliamentary groups of the SPD, Greens and FDP voted against it unanimously — in face of opposition from FDP politicians Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann and Wolfgang Kubicki. The motion failed.\nShould the FDP table another motion and should it be adopted, it would still be nonbinding. It is not the Bundestag that decides on arms deliveries, but the Federal Security Council, a secret Cabinet committee chaired by the chancellor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "New data requested by the left-wing populist BSW party shows around 3.2 million pensioners in Germany are at risk of poverty. Sahra Wagenknecht's party, only formed this year, frequently campaigns on such issues.\nSahra Wagenknecht, the leader of the new left-wing BSW party named after her, lamented a \"dramatic increase in old-age poverty\" in an interview with the German dpa news agency published on Saturday.\nThe BSW had issued a formal request for information to the European Union's statistical agency Eurostat, which found that around 3.2 million people aged 65 or over in Germany were at risk of poverty.\nEurostat's data suggests roughly one in six pensioners in the country fall into the category.\nThe figure had risen slightly in 2023, to 3.245 million, from 3.157 million the previous year. But in 2021, amid the inflationary pressure following the COVID pandemic, it had stood at 3.3 million.\nBack in 2013, only 2.4 million were at risk of poverty, with Eurostat's definition of this being if a pensioner's total income, including benefits, is less than 60% of the national median income.\nHowever, demographic changes in Germany and its aging population play a significant role in this increase, with the pensioner population increasing by more than 50% since 1991, from 12 million to 18.7 million by 2022.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"Pensioner poverty even affects the middle class in the meantime,\" Wagenknecht, who formally split from the socialist Left Party and formed the new party in January, told dpa on Saturday.\nShe claimed that neither Chancellor Olaf Scholz, also a former finance minister, nor his CDU challenger Friedrich Merz had an answer to the issue.\nWith a view to snap elections in February in Germany, Wagenknecht said good pensions were a \"focal point\" for her BSW.\nHer party frequently addresses such issues. Last month, it requested data from the German statistical office on the number of individuals aged 65 and over who required welfare payments to supplement their pensions in Germany.\nAlmost 730,000 people did so in the second quarter of 2024, Destatis found, again with a fairly sharp rise over the last 10 or so years amid the expanding pensioner population.\nWagenknecht also appeared in the publications of Germany's RND newspaper group on Saturday, again arguing for action to reduce living costs.\nIn this case, she was calling for more legislation in the Bundestag before February's elections, but this time not from the remaining minority government but rather led by the opposition.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShe said there would be a parliamentary majority to repeal contentious new laws on heating prices implemented earlier in the government's term.\nShe called the heating legislation one of the \"most illogical and in the long term expensive for citizens\" of the past three years.\n\"It doesn't protect the climate, but rather stands for the imposition of the state, wanting to govern right the way into our citizens' heating cellars,\" she told the newspapers.\nWagenknecht and the BSW are also  strapped for cash themselves, particularly now that the election date has been brought forward.\nWhile the new party would in theory now qualify for state campaign funding assistance for the next federal elections, having secured representation in the European Parliament and some state parliaments since its formation in January, party officials say the funds won't practically be available until 2025 and will therefore not flow in time.\nParty treasurer Ralph Suikat said on Friday that the BSW was seeking either donations from supporters, which it says it would repay in 2025, or if necessary more formal loans. Wagenknecht also said the campaign financing issue was posing \"certain challenges.\"\nmsh/lo (dpa, AFP, epd)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Lame duck? Not quite: Chancellor Olaf Scholz is determined to use his last weeks in office with a minority government to pass what he believes are vital laws. But he will be relying on the opposition to make it happen.\nIn between settling scores with his erstwhile finance minister during an occasionally hot-tempered speech in the Bundestag this week, Chancellor Olaf Scholz tried to take a conciliatory tone with the opposition.\n\"My proposal, my appeal to this house: Where we are unified, let us act unified. It would be good for our country,\" he told the chamber, before running through a few of the many draft laws now stuck in the parliamentary pipeline, and which he would like to push through before the end of his tenure. These include protecting the Constitutional Court, increasing child benefits and tax cuts.\nScholz's words were aimed mostly at the center-right opposition bloc of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party, the Christian Social Union (CSU), which — following the rupture of Scholz's coalition with the Free Democratic Party (FDP) — now holds most of the political power in the parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFriedrich Merz, the leader of the CDU/CSU group (and effectively now chancellor-in-waiting), warned the chancellor that his party would not be the \"reserve players for your broken coalition.\" And yet, political observers note, there is scope for cooperation between the parties — and there are indeed one or two draft laws that Merz's party has an interest in passing before the Bundestag election set for February 23, 2025.\nIn fact, one law was already passed on Thursday with the support of all the parties in the Bundestag, except the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) and the socialist Left Party. But it was relatively minor — a law regulating the inheritance of farms — and it may prove to be an exception because cooperating with Scholz will be a tactical risk for the CDU in the impending election campaign.\nUrsula Münch, director of the independent Tutzing Academy for Political Education, thinks the CDU will cooperate as little as possible with Scholz's minority government in the next few weeks.\n\"Even on measures that the CDU might consider worth striving for, it will always feel pressure not to improve Scholz's image,\" she told DW.\nMerz will also be keenly aware that any cooperation will leave him exposed to attacks from the far-right AfD and the populist Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht (BSW), who like to paint the CDU and SPD as indistinguishable parts of a mainstream \"cartel\" of the political classes.\nAs of now, only one of Scholz's big plans is certain to gain support from the CDU/CSU: the so-called \"AfD-proofing\" of the country's highest court.\nThis draft law, which CDU lawmakers helped to draw up, would ensure the number of judges (16), the judges' terms (12 years) and their maximum age (68) are fixed in the German constitution. A separate draft law is also being formulated to create alternative paths to electing judges, should there be an impasse in the German parliament.\nThese laws would effectively prevent the AfD — or any party that wins more than a third of the seats in the Bundestag — from blocking the selection of new judges to the court or changing rules relating to it. Given that the AfD could potentially significantly increase its share of seats in the Bundestag in February, it is seen as vital to pass the law now.\nBut everything else Scholz had planned is up for discussion — and the CDU/CSU has already said it would only begin negotiating after Scholz triggers the next election by losing his vote of confidence on December 16.\nEffectively assured, for now, is Germany's support for Ukraine, since the SPD, the CDU and the Greens agree that it is essential. However, the coalition government has failed to agree on a budget for 2025 — in fact, that's why it collapsed — which means that additional support for Ukraine has not yet been agreed, though existing orders will be unaffected. Scholz is hoping the CDU will agree to send more money sooner, though that is still up for discussion.\nAnother project that might find CDU support is finding extra packages to support Germany's ailing industrial sector. That was both a major theme of Merz's speech on Wednesday and of an \"industry summit\" that Scholz attended in October, when leading industry associations complained of the high energy costs in the country. Scholz wants to introduce caps on energy charges for the industry. Merz might well be on board for something along those lines, but only if he deems it so urgent that it can't wait until he is chancellor.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOne plan that does stand a chance of passing the Bundestag, whether or not it has CDU/CSU support, is the introduction of tax reductions to prevent \"bracket creep\" — when salary increases push earners into higher tax brackets leading to an effective drop in their net income. This can lead to decreased consumer spending and a so-called \"fiscal drag\" on the economy.\nThis tax relief was a demand of the Free Democrats, who are now expected to support the plan despite the acrimonious split. It is said to be worth €23 billion ($24 billion) — which could leave a hole in government finances.\nScholz is likely to have to say goodbye to many of his big plans. The pension reform, drawn up by the SPD-led Labor Ministry, would have meant keeping the pension level at 48% — the percentage of an average working income that a country's state pension provides in old age — until 2039.\nThe package also included the introduction of a share-based pension, intended to relieve the burden on the pension insurance system by using the income from a €200 billion ($210 billion) fund financed by loans and stock market investment. Both the CDU and the FDP have made clear that they would not support the move, on the grounds that keeping the pensions at a high level will disadvantage younger generations.\nAnother plan that now looks unlikely for the SPD to pass is a rise in child benefits from €250 to €255 a month. This will now probably have to wait for the approval of a 2025 budget in the next parliament. Theoretically, the Bundestag could introduce a law specifically to raise it, but, as Münch put it, \"I don't see the CDU doing Scholz that favor.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nCaught in a similar limbo is the Deutschlandticket, the Germany-wide ticket that allows travel on all local and regional transport for a fixed price. The government had already decided to continue the scheme but raise the price of this from €49 a month to €58, but its survival under a CDU/CSU-led government is far from assured.\nThe ticket is currently being subsidized jointly by the federal and state governments, but to extend the scheme will require a reform of that agreement — and some conservative-led states, like Bavaria, would like to see it scrapped altogether.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Despite poor approval ratings, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz will run again as the Social Democrats' top candidate in the 2025 federal elections. Why did the German government become so unpopular during his tenure?\nIn September, Olaf Scholz brushed aside a journalist's question about his legacy.\n\"I think you should be wary of politicians who think about that before their term in office has ended,\" he told Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper in response to the question of what he hoped would one day be written in the history books about his time in office.\nTwo months later, following the collapse of his center-left three-way coalition, he may be beginning to ponder that question. So far, the leadership of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD) is publicly demonstrating support for Scholz as their top candidate for the upcoming election on February 23, 2025. But with Scholz's low popularity ratings and the election campaign already heating up, calls in the party came up to replace Scholz with 64-year-old Defense Minister Boris Pistorius, who has been Germany's most popular politician in polls for months.\nIf, as predicted, the center-right bloc of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) takes over the chancellorship, Scholz will have had the shortest term of office of any of the four chancellors of the SPD in the history of the Federal Republic of Germany.\nBut Scholz is determined to win. In view of the current polls, which show the SPD only half as strong as the CDU/CSU, this is will be a real challenge.\nHaving said that, Scholz has never lacked self-confidence. Even in seemingly hopeless situations, he has always fervently believed he had everything under control. Critics have accused him of having a distorted perception of reality in such moments.\n\"You obviously live in your own cosmos, in your own world,\" said CDU leader Friedrich Merz in response to Scholz's upbeat speech in parliament a week after his coalition collapsed. \"You have not understood what is happening out there in the country at the moment.\"\nScholz's political career has been marked by ups and downs. His chancellorship faced several major challenges following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and Germany's tightrope walk of supporting Ukraine militarily without being drawn into the war itself.\nThe resulting energy crisis, inflation, the economic slump, the European asylum dispute and the unprecedented postwar electoral success of the far right — the federal government has had to deal with an extraordinary multitude of problems under Scholz.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHis coalition government, named the \"traffic light\" coalition after the three parties' colors — SPD (red), neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) (yellow) and environmentalist Greens — was an alliance full of political contradictions. It was a self-proclaimed \"progressive coalition\" formed after the 2021 general election, but the differences between party programs could not be bridged for long. After months of public bickering and backstabbing, it had become the most unpopular German government since the end of World War II.\nScholz, however, seems unfazed, pointing to the 2021 election campaign when he managed to buck the trend and win. Three months before the general election, victory for the SPD seemed impossible. The party was far behind in the polls, but Scholz was undeterred, saying again and again: \"I will become the chancellor.\"\nHis stoic optimism earned him much ridicule at the time, but one month before the vote, CDU candidate Armin Laschet made one mistake too many, and the SPD emerged the surprise winners garnering 25.7% of the vote, 1% ahead of the conservatives.\nFor Scholz, the 2021 win was the pinnacle of his decadeslong political career. He joined the SPD as a schoolboy in 1975. Before he entered the Bundestag in 1998, he ran his own law firm in Hamburg, held office as Hamburg's senator of the interior, as labor minister in the first \"grand coalition\" of the SPD and CDU/CSU under Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nThen he was governing mayor of the city-state of Hamburg for many years. \"Whoever orders leadership from me, gets it,\" he famously said when he took office there in 2011. In 2018, he moved back to Berlin as finance minister in another grand coalition under Merkel.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Scholz served as SPD secretary general alongside Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. It was during this time that the Hamburg weekly newspaper Die Zeit coined a phrase that stuck: \"Scholzomat\" — combining \"Scholz\" and \"Automat\" to reflect Scholz's dispassionate manner and technocratic language, like a machine whose job it is to unflinchingly sell government policy, showing no emotion.\nIn the years since, Scholz has been unable to shake off the image of the boring and fun-free bureaucrat. He sees himself as a fact-oriented pragmatist who, rather than putting on a show, only says as much as is absolutely necessary, while working quietly and efficiently.\nThat strategy worked well for him during his time as finance minister, when he quickly provided billions in aid to companies affected by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, he has failed to realize that the job of chancellor requires far more communication. Scholz has remained silent during the biggest of crises, rarely finding the right words, seeming arrogant and failing to win the hearts and minds of the people. But even though many supporters have called on him to change his style — to talk more, to become more approachable and even show some emotion — Scholz has refused to adapt, simply letting criticism roll off his back.\nEven though the SPD executive is currently demonstratively in favor of Scholz as the top candidate, he has not yet been nominated. The official nomination of a top candidate is scheduled to happen at a party conference in January.\nThis article was originally written in German. It was first published on November 15, 2024, and then updated when Boris Pistorius made clear that he is not competing with Scholz for the chancellorship.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

After months of public bickering and backstabbing, it had become the most unpopular German government since the end of World War II.\nScholz, however, seems unfazed, pointing to the 2021 election campaign when he managed to buck the trend and win. Three months before the general election, victory for the SPD seemed impossible. The party was far behind in the polls, but Scholz was undeterred, saying again and again: \"I will become the chancellor.\"\nHis stoic optimism earned him much ridicule at the time, but one month before the vote, CDU candidate Armin Laschet made one mistake too many, and the SPD emerged the surprise winners garnering 25.7% of the vote, 1% ahead of the conservatives.\nFor Scholz, the 2021 win was the pinnacle of his decadeslong political career. He joined the SPD as a schoolboy in 1975. Before he entered the Bundestag in 1998, he ran his own law firm in Hamburg, held office as Hamburg's senator of the interior, as labor minister in the first \"grand coalition\" of the SPD and CDU/CSU under Chancellor Angela Merkel.\nThen he was governing mayor of the city-state of Hamburg for many years. \"Whoever orders leadership from me, gets it,\" he famously said when he took office there in 2011. In 2018, he moved back to Berlin as finance minister in another grand coalition under Merkel.\nFrom 2002 to 2004, Scholz served as SPD secretary general alongside Chancellor Gerhard Schröder. It was during this time that the Hamburg weekly newspaper Die Zeit coined a phrase that stuck: \"Scholzomat\" — combining \"Scholz\" and \"Automat\" to reflect Scholz's dispassionate manner and technocratic language, like a machine whose job it is to unflinchingly sell government policy, showing no emotion.\nIn the years since, Scholz has been unable to shake off the image of the boring and fun-free bureaucrat. He sees himself as a fact-oriented pragmatist who, rather than putting on a show, only says as much as is absolutely necessary, while working quietly and efficiently.\nThat strategy worked well for him during his time as finance minister, when he quickly provided billions in aid to companies affected by the shutdowns during the COVID-19 pandemic.\nHowever, he has failed to realize that the job of chancellor requires far more communication. Scholz has remained silent during the biggest of crises, rarely finding the right words, seeming arrogant and failing to win the hearts and minds of the people. But even though many supporters have called on him to change his style — to talk more, to become more approachable and even show some emotion — Scholz has refused to adapt, simply letting criticism roll off his back.\nEven though the SPD executive is currently demonstratively in favor of Scholz as the top candidate, he has not yet been nominated. The official nomination of a top candidate is scheduled to happen at a party conference in January.\nThis article was originally written in German. It was first published on November 15, 2024, and then updated when Boris Pistorius made clear that he is not competing with Scholz for the chancellorship.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Germany's ex-Chancellor Angela Merkel backed her record on refugees, Russia and the economy as she presented her new memoir in Berlin. Critics have said that the 700-page tome is light on new insights.\nAngela Merkel, the longest-serving chancellor of a unified postwar Germany, was back in the spotlight on Tuesday evening. The Deutsches Theater in Berlin was the first port of call on Merkel's multi-continent tour to promote her autobiography Freedom. Memories 1954-2021.\nOn stage, Merkel was given the opportunity to defend her more controversial decisions. When pushed by journalist Anne Will to respond to critique that she was soft on Russia in exchange for cheap natural gas, that she did too little to address climate change or to fund the Bundeswehr, she pushed back by saying that many of those things were not solely in her control.\nShe also rejected accusations that she \"skimped Germany into destruction\" with her Christian Democratic (CDU) party's focus on saving money over spending it on, for example, aging infrastructure like the beleaguered national rail service Deutsche Bahn.\nWill also questioned Merkel about her 2015 decision to eschew certain European Union statutes that require refugees to be processed in the first EU country in which they arrive, instead welcoming asylum seekers from countries like Syria, Iraq, and Afghanistan unequivocally.\n\"The alternative was to turn people away,\" perhaps violently, from the German border, \"which for me, was so much worse,\" Merkel said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs in her book, the former chancellor largely evaded the question of being too conciliatory towards Russia, particularly after the annexation of Crimea in 2014, in order to procure cheap fuel for Germany.\nShe writes however that by accepting Ukraine's bid to join NATO, the West was sending a strong signal to the Kremlin.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin, however, features perhaps more prominently than any other leader in the book. She recalls him as someone who was \"always ready to disrespect others,\" particularly by showing up late.\n\"Probably his greatest joy was that the American president had to wait for him,\" she writes of Putin's behavior towards Barack Obama, who garners nearly as much attention in her memoir as the Russian president.\nShe describes the former US president glowingly, saying she knew right away \"he was someone I could work well with.\" She also appears to accept without question his assertion that he had no personal knowledge that the National Security Agency (NSA) was spying on her personal mobile phone when that information came to light in 2015.\nIn one of the rare unknown insights the book offers, she reveals that Obama was one of the confidantes she sought advice from when deciding whether to run for a fourth term in 2017.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs for US President-elect Donald Trump, she found him to be one person in front of cameras and another entirely when they were alone. In public, he refused to shake her hand and \"claimed that I had ruined Germany by taking in so many refugees in 2015 and 2016, accused us of spending too little on defense and criticized us for unfair trade practices.\"\nMerkel says that he acted \"as if Germany owed him and America something,\" but was uninterested in finding common ground or working on solutions.\nBehind closed doors, however, he had greeted her appropriately and appeared to \"want to like whoever he was talking to.\"\nAnalysts have pointed out that despite its 740-page heft, the book offers little in the way of self-reflection or indeed, little information at all that isn't already well known.\nThe book is also noticeably light on several topics, such as religion. Despite being the daughter of a pastor, Merkel doesn't speak much about Christian faith. There are a few scattered mentions of Islam, almost exclusively in connection with extremism and terrorism. Also hardly mentioned at length are non-Western world leaders, such as Narendra Modi or Xi Jinping and his predecessor Hu Jintao.\nAt the book launch, she did not take questions from the audience. She admitted towards the end, however, that she \"did not leave the country in perfect condition,\" in terms of climate protection and digitalization.\nNext, the former chancellor will head to other major European cities to promote her work and then to Washington, where Obama is expected to be on hand to support her.\nAdditional reporting by Christoph Strack"

The conservative CDU, however, is reluctant to back the chancellor.\nTax relief, economic development, child benefit increases, the extension of the Deutschland-Ticket monthly public transport pass — those are just four of around 100 draft laws now stalled in the legislature since last week's collapse of the governing coalition.\nThe government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz has been left high and dry now that his center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and Greens no longer have a parliamentary majority after the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) left the coalition.\nAddressing the Bundestag, Germany's lower house of parliament, on Wednesday, Scholz confirmed he would pave the way for a new election by calling a confidence vote on December 16. Subsequently, the German president will dissolve parliament, with February 23 now set as the election date.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nNevertheless, despite the election campaign, the current Bundestag will remain fundamentally competent to work and make decisions until the newly elected parliament meets for the first time. The chancellor sees this as an opportunity.\n\"We should use the time we have now and pass very important laws together for the citizens that do not tolerate delay, that are necessary,\" Scholz said.\nIn a direct appeal to the largest opposition group, the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU) and their Bavarian partners, the Christian Social Union (CSU), the chancellor said, \"For the good of the country, let us work together until the new election.\"\nBut the CDU may not be so willing to do that across the board. CDU leader Friedrich Merz found some sharp words as he settled his scores with Scholz.\n\"If you still want to complete certain projects of your broken government with our help, then we say to you: From this point on, you have no conditions to set,\" Merz said. \"We won't be the backup option for your broken government.\"\nMerz, who will run as the CDU/CSU's chancellor candidate next year, stressed it was possible to talk about individual measures only after the way for the new election had been paved.\n\"After we have decided on the vote of confidence, not before, because we do not trust promises they make to us beforehand,\" he said in parliament.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThere is not much that the CDU/CSU is still willing to support. \"We will support an amendment to the Basic Law that strengthens the position of the Federal Constitutional Court in our constitutional structure,\" said Merz. In addition, one could imagine the election of an additional or a new judge to the Federal Constitutional Court. But the list ends there.\n\"Some decisions, Mr. Chancellor, that you might like to see will objectively not be possible at all since we will enter the next year without an approved federal budget.\"\nDuring the ensuing debate, during which all the parties fired off several broadsides against one another, it became clear that the coming election campaign would be key to determining Germany's direction.\nScholz once again asserted that his coalition had failed because of a row over finances. The SPD and the Greens had repeatedly called for the so-called \"debt brake\" to be reformed and unsuccessfully pushed the FDP to take on additional loans.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Scholz, the FDP had insisted on playing foreign, domestic, economic and social security policies against each other financially. He said he could not allow that.\n\"I will never ask people to choose between investing in our security or in good jobs and the economy and infrastructure,\" said Scholz. He added that it was irresponsible to choose between either spending money on the Bundeswehr or secure pensions, or: \"Either we support Ukraine or we invest in Germany.\"\nMerz did not make any specific comments on how his conservatives would deal with finances if they won the election. However, it's clear that a government led by him would want to spend less money on social welfare.\nThe CDU/CSU has also decided to roll back the Greens' energy policy. \"We want to move away from the one-sided focus on wind and solar energy, e-mobility and heating systems using renewables,\" the CDU leader told lawmakers.\nMerz also sees a real need for change in other policy areas. \"Germany needs a fundamentally different policy, especially in migration policy, in foreign, security and European policy and in economic policy,\" he said on Wednesday.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe CDU/CSU are clearly ahead in the polls. If they were to win, however, the CDU/CSU would have to rely on finding partners to form a coalition government.

He has, however, ruled out any coalition with the Left Party, the populist Sahra Wagenknecht Aliance (BSW) and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\n\"Neither before nor after nor at any other time will there be any cooperation between my parliamentary group and those people, regardless of how many representatives they will have in the next German Bundestag,\" Merz vowed.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Germany's CDU party, currently the favorite to win Germany's upcoming election, wants to cut unemployment benefits for Ukrainian war refugees. The conservatives argue that the benefits discourage them from finding work.\nGermany's center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and the Christian Social Union (CSU) — currently leading in polls ahead of the election on February 23 next year — want to cut welfare benefits and get more of the country's 5.5 million long-term unemployed into the labor market.\nThey are also openly questioning whether Ukrainians should receive the standard unemployment benefit, called Bürgergeld (\"citizens' income\") rather than the lower asylum-seeker benefits. Following Russia's full-fledged invasion of Ukraine, refugees arriving in Germany and were subject to an EU Council Directive for temporary protection in the event of a mass influx of displaced persons for whom the regular asylum procedures do not apply. They were granted temporary residency status and entitled to full social welfare benefits.\nThe CSU's Stephan Stracke, social policy spokesman for the CDU/CSU's parliamentary group, told DW that while anyone fleeing \"war and violence\" had a right to protection, \"This does not mean, however, that there must be an automatic entitlement to the citizen's income in Germany.\" Instead, Stracke said, newly arrived Ukrainian war refugees should receive asylum-seeker benefits \"at first.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany is currently home to around 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees, around 530,000 of whom are classified by the Federal Employment Agency as eligible to work and entitled to citizens' income (as of May 2024).\nThat means they receive an unemployment benefit of up to €563 ($596) per month plus their rent and heating costs paid by the state. There is an extra allowance for children, staggered by age, and around 360,000 of the Ukrainian refugees in Germany are children. Stracke's proposal — for Ukrainians to receive the standard asylum seekers' benefit instead — would mean that Ukrainians would receive only €460 per month.\nThe CDU's move is part of a general planned overhaul of the Bürgergeld system if they get into power, which will include tougher sanctions for refusing work and more mandatory visits to the authorities.\nThe tougher comments on Ukrainian refugees are not new among German conservatives: Two years ago, CDU leader Friedrich Merz, who is predicted to head Germany's next government questioned the Ukranians' need for protection: \"We are now experiencing a form of social tourism among these refugees: to Germany, back to Ukraine, to Germany, back to Ukraine,\" Merz told the Bild TV outlet in 2022, triggering widespread outrage.\nIn a newly updated study, the German Institute for Employment Research (IAB) found that Germany was struggling to integrate Ukrainians into the job market, at least compared with other countries — but also that the situation was improving: Only 27% of Ukrainians in Germany had found work as of March this year, compared to 57% in Lithuania and 53% in Denmark (though that was still ahead of Ukrainians in Norway, Spain, and Finland, where only around 20% had found work). — and finding childcare and schooling has become increasingly difficult.\nAccording to Germany's right-wing parties, like the CDU and the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), the high number of refugees living off social welfare is partly down to the amount of money they receive. \"Germany has obviously not been particularly successful in getting Ukrainian refugees into work so far,\" said Stracke. \"Other European countries are doing much better. That is why we in Germany have to give more weight to the principle of supporting and challenging people to find work.\"\nBut the IAB study also shows that the proportion of Ukrainians in work is steadily rising in all the European countries — and that there is little evidence to show that there is a correlation with the amount of state help they receive. More significant factors than benefits, the IAB said, were language barriers and demand for labor in the low-wage sector, where it is easier to find work.\nIryna Shulikina, executive director at the Berlin-based NGO Vitsche, which supports Ukrainian refugees in Germany, said Ukrainians encounter several obstacles to finding work in Germany, most notably getting through the bureaucratic process. According to the IAB, some 72% of Ukrainian refugees have either a university degree or a vocational qualification — more than other refugees or the German working population in general.\n\"When they come here, they face the difficulties of getting their diplomas approved here,\" Shulikina said.\nTo name one example: Though Germany faces a shortage of medical workers, Shulikina said she had spoken to Ukrainian medical workers who needed two and a half years to get to the stage where they could work: Applying for work, getting their documents and qualifications approved, doing the necessary tests, learning the language. \"It's a real challenge,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhether a likely CDU-led government will succeed in changing conditions for Ukrainian refugees will depend also on its coalition partners: The center-left Social Democrats (SPD) are less inclined to crack down on social welfare recipients, while leading members of the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP), have already expressed their support for recategorizing Ukrainian war refugees — even though the party's parliamentary group declined to state an official position to DW for this article.\nShulikina put the current political debate on the issue of Bürgergeld down to election campaigning and did not accept the argument that the citizens' income was keeping Ukrainian refugees at home.\n\"All the people I know who are refugees and have anything to do with the Job Center are doing everything possible to end this relationship,\" she said. \"It's very humiliating and annoying. You are very dependent, and you are not perceived as an equal part of society — you're asked about every cent you spend and how and when. I don't believe there are a lot of people who enjoy getting Bürgergeld.\"\nLyudmyla Mlosch, chairperson of the Central Council of Ukrainians in Germany (ZVUD), said many Ukrainians she knows in Germany don't want to be here at all. \"I know a lot of people here who are dreaming of going home, but they have no home — they've lost everything,\" said Mlosch. \"Of course they need support.\"\nBut Mlosch did admit that some Ukrainians are more desperate than others: Those from the regions in the east that are under almost continual bombardment from Russia are more in need of state help, for example, as are older or sick people, or people who have no savings. \"They don't need to all be put in the same bracket. But younger people who can work, they could have their money reduced, I could admit that,\" she said.\nEdited by Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Friedrich Merz, an erstwhile rival of former German Chancellor Angela Merkel, has been a beacon of hope for the conservative CDU party. He now wants to unseat Chancellor Olaf Scholz and take over as Germany's leader.\nFriedrich Merz has a good chance of becoming Germany's next chancellor. As the leader of the center-right Christian Democratic Union party (CDU) and the conservative parliamentary group that includes Bavaria's Christian Social Union (CSU), he will be the bloc's top candidate, taking on the Social Democrats (SPD) in the February 23 general election. Though Merz has never held government office, opinion polls suggest that he is the favorite in the race.\n \nAt the age of 69, Merz would become the oldest person to take office as Germany's head of government since Konrad Adenauer, who was 73 years old when he was sworn in as the first chancellor of the Federal Republic in 1949.\n \nMerz has had two political lives: one before Angela Merkel came to power as chancellor in 2005 and the second after she exited in 2021.\nHe had slowly withdrawn from politics after Merkel's initial election as German chancellor. Merkel, who is often referred to as Merz's \"nemesis,\" was a pragmatist and moderate who did not see eye to eye with the staunch conservative Friedrich Merz.\nHe then took a break from politics in 2009, returning to the Bundestag only in 2021 after Merkel had retired.\nMerz hails from the rural Sauerland area of Germany's most-populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia. He is a wealthy corporate lawyer, a father of three and a Catholic. He started his political career as amember of the European Parliament for the CDU in 1989, at the age of 33. Five years later, in 1994, he switched to the German lower house of Parliament, the Bundestag, where his sharp oratory skills drew attention. He became an influential member of the conservative parliamentary group (CDU/CSU).\nMerz's withdrawal from politics dovetailed with successes in the private sector: From 2005 to 2021, he was a member of the international law firm Mayer Brown LLP and held top positions on supervisory and administrative boards. From 2016 to 2020, Merz was chairman of the supervisory board of the German arm of Blackrock, the world's largest asset manager.\nIn 2022, on Merz's third attempt at the post, the CDU elected him as party leader.\nMerz had a reputation as an economically liberal representative of the conservative CDU wing. In 2008 he wrote a book entitled \"Mehr Kapitalismus wagen\" (Dare More Capitalism) championing a liberal economic policy, slashing bureaucracy, reducing social benefits and cutting taxes for companies.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the 1990s, Merz was in the minority even in the conservative CDU when he voted against liberalizing the abortion law and against preimplantation genetic diagnostics in the Bundestag. When parliament passed a bill to criminalize marital rape like any other rape in 1997, Merz voted against it.\nMerz has always been a supporter of nuclear energy and has expressed doubts over renewable energy sources such as \"ugly\" wind turbines.\nHe drew flak in 2022 for flying his private jet to attend Finance Minister Christian Lindner's wedding on the island of Sylt at a time of rising energy prices caused by Russia's war on Ukraine.\nMerz has also been accused of pandering to the far right with denigrating remarks about refugees.\nOn a TV talk show, he said female school teachers in Germany were experiencing a lack of respect from what he called \"little pashas,\" apparently referring to sons of Muslim parents.\nThat remark came only weeks after Merz referred to some displaced Ukrainians as \"welfare tourists\" — claiming that many of them had come to Germany seeking safety, only to then travel back and forth between both countries once they have secured social benefits.\nMerz later offered an apology of sorts: \"I regret using the word 'welfare tourism.' It was an inaccurate description of a problem observed in individual cases.\"\nMerz previously complained about \"problems with foreigners\" and insisted on a German \"Leitkultur\" (dominant culture),  a term dating back to the 1990s that many argue is a call for compulsory assimilation.\nHe represents a CDU that has become more conservative, although he has stated his refusal to cooperate with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).\nShortly after Germany's center-left government collapsed on November 6, 2024, Merz stated in clear terms that the years of Scholz's coalition were now history, arguing that this had been a long time coming.\nMerz is hoping that he and the CDU/CSU will replace Olaf Scholz and his minority government with the Greens following the February 23 election. It remains to be seen which coalition partners he would choose to form a new government.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Excerpts from former German Chancellor Angela Merkel's soon-to-be-published autobiography cover everything from growing up in a dictatorship to the conflict in Ukraine. A look at the key quotes.\nAngela Merkel was the longest-serving chancellor of a post-war, united Germany, earning a reputation for calm and pragmatic leadership. On Thursday, Die Zeit published passages from her highly anticipated book Freedom. Memories 1954-2021.\nHere are some of the key takeaways.\nBorn in Hamburg in what was then West Germany in 1954, her father's work took the family to Brandenburg in the former East Germany when she was a baby.\nIn her book, she describes childhood under the East German (GDR) dictatorship as \"a life constantly on the edge. No matter how carefree a day began, everything could change in a matter of seconds\" if someone around her stepped out of line.\n\"The state knew no mercy,\" she writes, adding that realizing what lines could not be crossed was an important skill, even for a child. \"My pragmatic approach helped me\" in that regard, she says.\nThe ex-chancellor writes that despite the GDR's attempts to totally control its citizens, she maintained her carefree attitude and would come to disdain the \"pettiness, narrow-mindedness, tasteless and...humorlessness\" of the East German regime.\nIn Germany's 2005 federal election, Merkel was selected to represent the center-right CDU/CSU bloc over, among others, current CDU leader Friedrich Merz.\nShe says she found \"a difference between theory and practice\" in the acceptance of a female candidate for head of government. \"There were doubts about this\" she writes, even \"deep within the ranks of women\" in her party.\nMerkel then explains the challenge of going up against then-Chancellor Gerhard Schröder and his reputation for being \"energetic and smart.\"\n\"Any man who challenged the chancellor...would have felt the same way. But being a woman, I felt, was definitely not an advantage.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn an excerpt on meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin at the 2007 Munich Security Conference, Merkel says Putin presented himself as \"someone who was always on his guard, not to be trifled with, and always ready to dish it out.\"\nShe confirms a famous story that Putin brought his large Labrador to a private meeting with her. It is well-known that an earlier incident left Merkel with a phobia of dogs, but Putin has denied doing it on purpose to intimidate her.\nShe also says he regularly arrived late for the purpose of making people wait.\n\"You could find all this childish, reprehensible, you could shake your head at it,\" but that didn't make Russia any less important on the world stage, the ex-chancellor says. She goes on to describe him as singularly preoccupied with the United States, as if longing for the days of the Cold War.\nMerkel also sheds some light on her infamous first meeting with US President Donald Trump in 2017. An incident went viral on social media in which Merkel appeared to ask Trump to shake hands for a photo, and he ignored her.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShe writes that he appeared to not understand her request, and then pelted her with questions about growing up under a dictatorship.\nHe was interested in \"my East German background and my relationship with Putin. He was clearly very fascinated by the Russian president,\" Merkel says, adding: \"In the years that followed, I had the impression that has was captivated by politicians with autocratic and dictatorial tendencies.\"\nShe asserts that Trump spent the rest of their first meeting criticizing her.\n\"He claimed that I had ruined Germany by taking in so many refugees in 2015 and 2016, accused us of spending too little on defense and criticized us for unfair trade practices,\" according to Merkel.\nMerkel suggests that Trump saw everything through the eyes of a real estate mogul, and did not appear to understand the intertwined global economy, complaining about German cars on New York City streets.\n\"We were talking on two different levels, Trump on the emotional level, me on the factual level. When he did pay attention to my arguments, it was mostly just to turn them into new accusations,\" she says. \"Resolving the issues raised did not appear to be his goal.\"\nIn the book, Merkel admits to being hesitant to accelerate Kyiv's bid to join NATO.\nShe describes a 2008 NATO summit in Bucharest, where Ukraine and Georgia's applications to join the alliance were on the agenda.\nMerkel notes her concerns over Kyiv's relationship with Russia, although then-Ukrainian President Viktor Yushchenko had sought closer ties to Europe. She also claims that at the time, only a minority of Ukrainians supported NATO membership, stressing the need for new NATO states to add to the overall security for all members.\nMerkel has faced criticism from Ukrainians for being too hands-off in her approach to their country. She writes, however, that allowing Ukraine's membership bid to stand was a clear signal to Putin as to where the West stood.\nEdited by: Sean M.

    "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democratic Party has launched its election campaign and promised to reverse its flagging fortunes. Scholz accused one of his former coalition allies of sabotage.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Saturday told his party a February general election would mark a crucial decision on the country's future.\nDespite poor showings in the polls for his center-left Social Democrats (SPD), Scholz and party leader Lars Klingbeil promised that the party would turn things around.\n\"There is a hell of a lot at stake,\" said Scholz, the SPD's candidate for chancellor in the likely election.\n\"We are facing a fundamental decision for our country, one way or the other,\" he told the audience at the event at the party's Berlin headquarters. \"Now it's about everything. If we take a wrong turn in Germany now, in this situation, it will have serious consequences.\"\nAlso speaking at the opening of a campaign conference at the SPD's Berlin headquarters on Saturday, party leader Lars Klingbeil was upbeat about the party's prospects.\n\"The Social Democrats are standing together, but above all, the Social Democrats are highly motivated for this election campaign,\" he said.\n\"85 days, it's going to be a tough ride. It will challenge us,\" Klingbeil added, referring to what promises to be a tense race to the early parliamentary elections expected to be held on February 23.\n\"If there's one thing the SPD can do, it's fight: we're a party for catching up, and we're going to show that over the next 85 days,\" Klingbeil said.\nAccording to one poll, Scholz was clearly gaining ground in terms of voter approval over his challenger Friedrich Merz, the chancellor candidate for the center-right Christian Democrats (CDU).\nIn the survey published on Saturday by the opinion research institute Insa on behalf of the Bild newspaper, 22% of respondents said they would vote for Scholz directly as chancellor if this option existed in Germany.\nThe figure shows a 7 percentage point uptick on the previous week. However, 30% still said they would vote for Merz. Meanwhile, 16% said they would choose Robert Habeck, of the Greens — a slight dip compared with last week.\nScholz's three-way coalition government collapsed after he fired ex-Finance Minister Christian Lindner of the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) in early November after months of strong disagreements over budget plans for 2025.\nAs a result, the FDP withdrew from the government, whittling down Scholz's coalition to a minority government with the Greens.\nScholz opened his speech with attacks on Lindner, saying the FDP leader and party \"systematically sabotaged\" the work of the government for months.\n\"They wanted to actively prevent this federal government from being successful,\" said Scholz. \"Something like that must never happen again in Germany.\"\nrc/wmr (dpa, AFP, Reuters)"

The far-right was also expected to make gains.\nRomania's ruling Social Democrats (PSD) appeared to have won the most votes in a parliamentary election on Sunday, coming in ahead of a resurgent far-right movement challenging the country's pro-Western orientation, an exit poll showed.\nWith roughly 85% of ballots counted, early returns have the PSD taking some 23.5% of the vote, ahead of the hard-right Alliance for the Union of Romania (AUR) with 17.8%.\nHowever, all the far-right parties made large gains. Their combined result was around 30%, indicating a fragmented parliament.\nCommenting on the exit polls, Romanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu, a Social Democrat, said voters had confirmed they wanted investment to continue.\n\"It is an important signal that Romanians have sent to the political class,\" said Ciolacu after the exit poll was published. Ciolacu said the country should continue on its European path, while \"protecting our identity, national values and faith.\"\nOn Sunday, AUR leader George Simion, who recently won nearly 14% of the presidential vote, said, \"Today the Romanian people voted for the pro-sovereignty forces,\" adding, \"It is the beginning of a new era in which the Romanian people reclaim the right to decide their destiny.\"\nIf the exit polls are confirmed by official results, a pro-Western coalition led by the PSD is likely to have enough seats in parliament to form a government.\nHowever, the exit polls do not include the votes of the hundreds of thousands of Romanians working abroad, who are expected to favor far-right groups and a centrist opposition.\nSunday's vote is the second of three consecutive elections for a new parliament and president. After the first round of the presidential election a week ago, independent far-right candidate Calin Georgescu emerged from relative obscurity as the front-runner.\nThe parliamentary elections took place against the backdrop of a recount of the first round of last week's presidential election, following Georgescu's surprise victory.\nThe recount was ordered by the Constitutional Court amid allegations of irregularities and possible interference in the election. The court is expected to decide next week whether the runoff between Georgescu and reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union (USR) will go ahead as planned on December 8.\nWho gets to form the government will depend on who wins the presidential election, as the president appoints a prime minister, and the timetable for doing so is unclear.\nRomania, which has a 650-kilometer (400-mile) border with Ukraine, has played an important role in Western support for Kyiv. In addition to providing military aid, it also enabled the export of millions of tons of Ukrainian grain through its Black Sea port of Constanta.\ndh/sms (AFP, AP, Reuters)"

    "content": "Angela Merkel was chancellor when Germany pulled the Bundeswehr out of Afghanistan and the Taliban conquered Kabul in 2021. She was the last witness to testify before a Bundestag committee of inquiry this week.\nThe international mission in Afghanistan lasted 20 years. Under the leadership of the US, Germany was also involved from the very beginning — both in a military and in a humanitarian capacity.\nThe mission came to an abrupt end on August 15, 2021, when the Taliban captured the presidential palace in Kabul.\nNobody in the German government, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, apparently saw the Islamists' rapid triumph coming. The evacuation of both German citizens and Afghan personnel was chaotic.\nSince 2022, a committee of inquiry in the Lower House of Parliament, the Bundestag has been trying to find out how this misjudgment came about. As the last witness, the former head of government has to answer several hours of questions from lawmakers.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nReading from a prepared statement, Merkel said Germany's participation in the US-led military invasion of Afghanistan was the correct decision even in retrospect. She repeated some of the phrases she used in a government statement just a few days after the Taliban's triumph.\nMerkel said there had been a \"well-founded hope\" that the military intervention would prevent terrorist attacks from being planned in Afghanistan.\nShe acknowledged that foreign governments had failed in Afghanistan on nearly every objective, from encouraging the rule of law to women's rights issues.\nMerkel said a lack of cultural understanding by Afghanistan's Western allies, nepotism and drug trafficking were reasons for the failures.\nMerkel says that initially, she was more reluctant to include local personnel from the field of development cooperation. In doing so, she wanted to avoid giving the impression that Germany was abandoning Afghanistan.\nMerkel's account is consistent with the testimony of her confidant at the time, Helge Braun, who coordinated the German government's Afghanistan policy in the Chancellery. Braun was questioned directly before Merkel in the committee of inquiry and also defended the Federal Intelligence Service (BND). The BND had considered a rapid takeover of power by the Taliban to be “rather unlikely”.\nThe Bundestag's committee of inquiry has been looking into decision-making procedures and actions of the German government and intelligence services, including the interaction with foreign actors.\nIt will have to present its final report before this legislative period ends in February 2025.\nMerkel-era Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Development Minister Gerd Müller were among the last officials of the time to be questioned. Even right before the Taliban marched unopposed into the Afghan capital, Maas, of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), had claimed that such a scenario was very unlikely.\n\"All of us — the German government, the intelligence services, the international community — we all misjudged the situation,\" he said later.\nNow, three years later, the inquiry committee asked Maas for his assessment of the German government's policy in Afghanistan. \"The cooperation within the government was very transparent and thorough,\" Maas said.\nMaas acknowledged that, on some specific factual issues, there were different interpretations.\n\"But everyone tried to make the best of the situation,\" Maas said. He added that issuing visas for Afghan personnel who feared Taliban revenge could have been handled better. \"It may have been possible to get a lot of people out earlier if an agreement had been reached more quickly,\" Maas surmised.\nThis article was originally written in German. It was updated following former Chancellor Angela Merkel's testimony on December 5, 2024.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "German Development Minister Svenja Schulze sees new potential for Germany's involvement in Syria. And finds herself defending her projects against criticism, including from right-wing extremists.\nSvenja Schulze, the German development minister of the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD), had scheduled a press conference in Berlin to speak about the last three extremely difficult years for her ministry: During this time, the projects she has been working on around the world had come under constant attack. Especially from right-wing populists who have been gaining ground in Germany and who often express nothing but hatred and derision for anyone offering support to the poor in the global South.\nBut given the very urgent situation in Syria, the SPD politician took the opportunity to talk about the new potential she sees for Germany's involvement there. In the years since the start of the Syrian civil war in 2011, German development assistance to the country has fallen to currently €125 million ($132 million).\nThat money was used to support United Nations projects, such as providing drinking water to Aleppo. In other words, the basic necessities on the smallest level, more was simply not possible because of the constant fighting in the country.\nBut now Schulze wants to do more. \"The Development Ministry has been preparing for this moment for 13 years. Building state structures is our core business,” she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBut it was this core business that was repeatedly criticized during the almost three years in which the coalition government of SPD, environmentalist Greens, and neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP)were in power.\nDuring negotiations on the 2025 budget, Schulze only just managed to secure €10.3 billion for her ministry, almost a billion euros less than in 2024. There had been repeated claims that Germany could no longer afford expensive projects abroad at a time when housing is becoming scarce and infrastructure is crumbling at home.\nFollowing the collapse of the coalition, the budget remains unresolved, but it seems unlikely that the Development Ministry will receive more money in the future. Still clearly outraged, Schulze said: \"What was new was the intensity of the criticism and the deliberate spreading of falsehoods. We saw a perfect example of this with the now famed bike paths in Peru.\"\nThe Alternative for Germany (AfD), a party with some far-right extremist factions, had claimed that Schulze was spending a whopping €315 million on new cycle paths in the Latin American country. In fact, it was only around 20 million euros in grants and a further 40 million euros in loans — money that will be paid back. Schulze has now added the information that German companies were also involved in the construction of the bike paths, which were used as a means of connecting to the metro system. Because German companies were involved, the project was also of benefit to the German economy.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAccording to Schulze, the projects in Peru are a good example of the principles on which she bases her development cooperation: In an increasingly multipolar world, she said, support for poorer countries must be given on an equal footing, otherwise many countries will turn to Russia or China, which often cooperate on the basis of geopolitical interests: \"The countries of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rightly becoming increasingly self-confident. They choose their partners. And it is our task to remain a strong partner in this new, multipolar world.\"\nAccording to the minister, another priority over the past three years has been the attempt to develop projects that are more strongly feminist in their approach. And this is another issue for which the ministry has repeatedly been criticized. Schulze announced a goal that by 2025, at least 93% of all projects approved will be designed to promote gender equality. In 2022, this was only the case for 66% of projects, whereas in 2024 it rose to around 91%.\nThe Development Policy Report is published once per legislative period and primarily serves to provide the Bundestag with an overview of development policy. Despite all of her efforts, it remains uncertain whether the SPD politician Schulze will be able to continue her work. Now that the FDP has left the government, the Social Democrats and the Greens are governing as a minority government.\nAnd a new Bundestag will be elected on February 23. Svenja Schulze's party, the SPD, is currently far behind the conservatives in the polls.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Pressure is mounting among Germany's Social Democrats to decide on the political future of Chancellor Olaf Scholz. Many would prefer Defense Minister Boris Pistorius to lead the party into February's federal election.\nSenior figures from Germany's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) met on Tuesday evening to discuss whether or not Chancellor Olaf Scholz is still the right man to lead the party into a snap election in February — or whether Defense Minister Boris Pistorius would be a better option.\nThe 2025 federal election has been brought forward after Scholz's three-way coalition government collapsed on November 6, prompting Germany's main parties to switch into campaign mode and nominate their potential candidates for the chancellery.\nTraditionally, an incumbent chancellor would be expected to lead their party into an election but, with less than 100 days to go until the vote and Scholz's popularity at rock bottom, calls are growing within the SPD for change.\n\"It's completely clear that we want to stand together. And I can't complain about the support from the party leadership,\" Scholz said on private broadcasters ProSieben/Sat.1 late on Tuesday.\n\"We want to be successful together,\" he told reporters in Rio as the G20 summit drew to a close. \"Together, the SPD and I.\"\nTuesday's meeting involved several senior SPD politicians withing the party apparatus but not Pistorius; Scholz was in Rio and did not join the discussions.\n\"The image of Chancellor Scholz is strongly associated with the coalition,\" said two SPD regional leaders from North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW), Germany's most populous state, adding that they were hearing \"a lot of support for Pistorius\" in their constituencies.\n\"Many party colleagues view Scholz very critically and would prefer Pistorius,\" said another regional SPD chair in the state of Lower Saxony. \"We would welcome it if Scholz were to reflect and take the appropriate steps.\"\nFormer SPD leader Sigmar Gabriel also advised against \"business as usual with Chancellor Scholz,\" warning that the party could end up polling under 15% if no change is made. In the central German state of Thuringia, the SPD mayor of Gotha predicted \"a dreadful defeat\" for the party were Scholz to continue.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nPistorius had originally made comments implying he did not want the nomination and that his desire would be to remain defense minister in the next German government.\nBut on Monday, when asked by reporters if he would \"rule out\" a nomination as chancellor candidate, he said, \"in politics you should never rule anything out, regardless of what.\"\nThe only thing he could categorically rule out, he said, was that \"I'll become the pope.\"\nScholz was at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro and not expected to return to Germany until Wednesday.\nOn the sidelines of the summit, he told several media outlets that he intends to lead the SPD into the election. \"The SPD and I are going into the election to win it,\" he said, adding that he felt he enjoyed clear support.\nOn Monday, SPD party bosses Saskia Esken and Lars Klingbeil said Scholz's candidacy was not up for debate, while the chancellor also received backing from his home city of Hamburg, where local SPD leaders insisted Scholz was \"the right person\" for the job.\nIn nearby Bremen, SPD chairwoman Gesa Wessolowski-Müller said, \"Olaf Scholz represents calm-headed politics for all of society.\"\nAsked on Monday evening about a potential candidacy, Defense Minister Pistorius declared his loyalty to Scholz and to his party.\nPistorius, currently polling as Germany's most popular politician having played a prominent role in Berlin's support for Ukraine since the full-scale Russian invasion 1,000 days ago, reiterated instead that he is a \"deeply loyal person\" and a \"soldier of the party.\"\n\"Pistorius is popular, as opposed to Scholz,\" wrote the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) on Tuesday. \"He cut a strong figure in the most important ministry there currently is and he has an aura which Scholz doesn't have.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"A chancellor putsch in the middle of an election campaign is an incalculable risk,\" wrote the local daily Rhein-Zeitung in the western city of Koblenz. \"But Scholz's communication weaknesses, his lack of self-criticism and his eroding power will not have escaped the SPD leadership. They must act now.\"\nThe party does appear to be in agreement that it has to act decisively and quickly. \"We're currently in an undesirable state of flux,\" SPD parliamentary leader Johannes Fechner told Die Welt on Tuesday.\n\"It's vital that the party leadership decides swiftly,\" Philipp Türmer, head of the SPD youth branch, told Spiegel. \"If it's Scholz, the leadership also needs to explain how we're going to turn the negative mood around and regain lost trust.\"\nmf/rt (dpa, Reuters, AFP)"

Olaf Scholz stands for reason and prudence.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAsked by public broadcaster ZDF about his superior poll ratings, Pistorius insisted that \"other barometers are more important\" because poll ratings are \"also fleeting\" and cannot necessarily \"be translated into votes on ballot papers.\"\nWhat's more, he said, stripping a sitting chancellor of the candidacy would be \"a poor signal to send in these times,\" both at home and abroad.\nSPD co-chair Saskia Esken welcomed Pistorius' withdrawal, calling the decision \"self-assured and a huge show of solidarity with the SPD and Chancellor Scholz.\"\nSpeaking to the Rheinische Post newspaper on Thursday night, she added: \"Boris Pistorius is an outstanding defense minister and we'll be fighting this election to ensure that he can continue to hold this position in the next government, too.\"\nWhat role the SPD will play in that government remains to be seen.\nRecent polls put the center-left party on just 14-16%, far behind the conservative Christian Democrats (CDU) and their chancellor candidate Friedrich Merz at 32-24%, but also behind the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) at 18-19%.\nScholz recently questioned the \"reliability\" of the polls, reminding the Süddeutsche Zeitung that the SPD had also been lagging far behind the CDU two-and-a-half months before the 2021 election, before CDU candidate Armin Laschet was filmed laughing during a visit to the flood-hit Ahrtal region.\nReactions to Scholz's impending repeat candidacy on Thursday night were not restricted to his own party, as political rivals also had their say.\n\"It's fine by me if Mr Scholz is the SPD's candidate for chancellor,\" said a sarcastic Christian Lindner, leader of the economically liberal Free Democrats and Germany's Finance Minister before his dismissal by Scholz earlier this month led to the coalition government's collapse.\n\"The people know what they're getting, and what not: economic change.\"\nCDU parliamentary chief Thorsten Frei told Berlin's Tagesspiegel newspaper that, while Scholz may have won the SPD's internal power struggle, he emerges from it \"catastrophically damaged.\"\n\"It's clear that large parts of the party don't want to follow Scholz and don't trust him to win the election,\" he added.\nAlexander Dobrindt from the CSU, the CDU's Bavarian sister party, suggested that the SPD's internal debates are far from over, claiming that the decision to run with Scholz \"was not shared by large parts of the party … but that's the SPD's problem, not ours.\"\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Germany has long been regarded as a leader on climate action, but the outgoing coalition leaves a mixed legacy.\nWhen Germany's coalition took office three years ago, each party came with its own ideas of how to cut the nation's emissions. Negotiations led to what was regarded as an ambitious compromise.\nAt the time, Robert Habeck, the Green Party economy and climate minister, said the agreement would \"accelerate the transition to renewable energy, restructure industry and finally put us on the 1.5-degree-Celsius [2.7 F] path,\" referring to the warming threshold set out in the Paris climate accord.\nBut the recent implosion of the coalition government — made up of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's center-left Social Democrats, the Greens and neoliberal Free Democrats — partly because of climate policy, has set the country on a different path.\nWith the SPD and Greens now leading the minority government until the February election, what has the coalition government achieved in terms of climate action?\nJust nine out of 27 planned climate and environment laws have been implemented by the SPD-led government. One law that did make it onto the books, despite fierce opposition from the public and the FDP, was the Building Energy Act. It aims for a gradual increase in the number of homes and buildings heated with renewable energy, and for 6 million oil and gas heating systems to be replaced with heat pumps by 2030.\n\"The law is better than its reputation, but disastrous in terms of how it was communicated,\" said Claudia Kemfert, an energy economist with economic think tank DIW Berlin. But with only some 1.8 million new heat pumps installed, the country is lagging far behind the target, she added.\nThe legislative process for other potential laws, such as implementing climate-resilient forestry practices, tax breaks for electric company cars and stronger marine protection, barely made it out of the starting block, if at all. And the promised \"climate bonus\" — financial relief to compensate for increases in the national CO2 price implemented in the heating and transport sectors — never made it to consumers.\nThat's because a constitutional court ruling last year enforcing Germany's limits on debt left a gaping €60 billion chasm in the federal finances, forcing the coalition to cut or halt investments in climate and infrastructure initiatives.\nMeanwhile, German environmental NGO BUND is taking legal action against the Federal Climate Action Act — meant to be the foundation of the country's climate policy — because it says the law is insufficient.\nThe act, amended in summer 2023 after a long dispute, brings forward Germany's aim of being climate neutral to 2045 instead of 2050. The country also aims to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 65% instead of 55% this decade.\n\"Germany is absolutely not on a 1.5-degree path, because we have climate targets that do not do justice to the state of scientific knowledge,\" said Tina Löffelsend, climate expert at BUND.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAn analysis by NGO Climate Action Tracker said the law weakens Germany's climate policies and will make it almost impossible to achieve net zero by 2045. The amendment abolished binding annual goals for emissions cuts in individual sectors like transport, building, energy and agriculture in favor of an overall target, according to the independent scientific project that tracks government climate policies.\nThe change takes pressure off individual ministries like transport and building, which consistently miss their emissions targets.\nBut Dirk Messner, head of Germany's Federal Environment Agency (UBA), is confident the country will meet its 2030 targets, even though \"we are not doing brilliantly in all sectors.\" Messner added in a statement that more needs to be done — particularly in the transport sector — to phase out climate-damaging subsidies.\nOne target the country will likely miss, according to analysts, is its 2030 goal of having 15 million electric cars on the road. Currently, the number is 2.3 million, including hybrid models. At the end of 2023, the coalition was forced to cancel subsidies for purchasing e-cars because of the budget deficit.\nExpansion of electric car charging infrastructure is also lagging, with Oliver Blume, CEO of beleaguered German carmaker Volkswagen Group, calling for renewed support in building out the network. German carmakers, which are playing catch-up in the e-car segment, are seeing falling vehicle sales, with Volkswagen planning thousands of layoffs.\nRenewable energy expansion is doing much better than e-mobility, according to Claudia Kemfert. \"Important framework conditions have been significantly improved in the solar energy and wind energy sectors,\" she said, although she also advocates for stronger climate action.\nThe share of green energy in the country's electricity mix is now over 60%, up from 43% in 2021. If Germany reaches its 80% by 2030 goal \"would be an important milestone in achieving the climate targets,\" added Kemfert.\nAt the same time, Russia's war in Ukraine has made it more difficult to implement climate policies set out in the coalition agreement, said Kemfert.\nAfter Russia's invasion in 2022, the country cut billions of cubic meters of pipeline gas supplies to Europe. Germany was particularly dependent on Russian gas. Energy prices skyrocketed, forcing the country to act quickly.\n\"It must be acknowledged that this [energy] crisis was handled well,\" said BUND climate analyst Löffelsend.\nGermany built new liquefied natural gas (LNG terminals) in the North Sea and diversified its supply with gas from other countries. But this also created an overcapacity, \"which will cost us all dearly,\" said Löffelsend. Like coal and oil,  LNG is a fossil fuel and burning it drives planetary heating.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUBA's Messner told DW that concerns the outbreak of the war would see a \"coal and fossil fuel renaissance\" in Germany turned out to be unfounded. \"This is mainly due to the very successful expansion of renewable energies.\"\nLast year, German emissions fell around 10%, the sharpest decline since 1990. Still, that's not all down to climate policy. A sluggish economy and declines in production also played a role, said UBA.\nWith a political crisis at home to manage, Chancellor Olaf Scholz cancelled his attendance at the UN climate conference in Baku, Azerbaijan last week. Negotiators at the summit are trying to hash out a new financing target for developing countries to cope with climate disasters and transform their energy systems. Rich and poor states are at odds over who should pay and how much.\nGermany is negotiating as part of the EU delegation and is still a strong partner despite domestic troubles, Jennifer Morgan, the country's special envoy for climate policy, told DW.\n\"We have a full mandate from the existing minority government,\" said Morgan last week in Baku, adding that Germany stands by its climate commitments.\nStill, Oxfam climate analyst Jan Kowalzig fears the prospect of an entirely new government in February and Germany's mixed climate record at home could hold back partner countries from bolstering their own efforts. Germany has traditionally played a leading role in climate policy.\nTo keep global warming under 1.5 degrees Celsius , the limit agreed in Paris, states must collectively cut emissions 42% by the end of the decade. And the world is currently a long way off that target.\nThis article was originally written in German."

    "content": "Germany's Greens have nominated Economy Minister Robert Habeck as their lead candidate in upcoming election. Becoming the next chancellor may be a tall order for Habeck, but the Greens are hoping for a pre-vote boost.\nLawmakers from the Greens voted overwhelmingly in favor of Robert Habeck, Germany's deputy chancellor and economy minister, running as the party's lead candidate in February's early federal election.\nHabeck won 741 of 768 votes, or 96.48%, at the hastily-arranged conference in Wiesbaden, western Germany, on Sunday.\n\"With this speech I'm applying for permission to lead you in the election campaign,\" the 55-year-old former children's author told delegates before the vote.\nHabeck said he knew he'd lost trust among the public in recent years in the governing coalition, but said he wanted to take responsibility as the party's \"candidate for the people in Germany.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAs the result was read out in Wiesbaden, Habeck responded with a play on words in German that indicated his acceptance of the result and his desire to tackle the upcoming national election.\n\"We'll take [on] this vote,\" he said.\nThe nomination means Habeck is the party's choice for chancellor, should it be in a position to field one.\nBut Habeck and the Greens have been open about this being a distant prospect, given that they are currently polling in the region of 11% or 12% support.\nHe did bring up the notion of getting all the way to the chancellery in Sunday's speech to delegates, which lasted around an hour, but stressed how this would only be possible if campaign momentum \"carries us very far.\"\nAhead of the conference, Habeck told DW that he hoped current polls could prove misleading by February. All three members of the now-collapsed coalition had been suffering in the polls amid the public arguments, logjams and compromises on policy as they tried to keep the fractious alliance together.\n\"All the disputes, all the compromises that we had to make are now gone. And now the parties are stepping forward with their own ideas. Now a lot can change on all fronts,\" he said.\nFour years ago, Habeck stepped aside to allow Annalena Baerbock, now foreign minister, to take a shot at the top job. She said earlier this year that she wanted to focus on her current post, partly given the fragile geopolitical situation, and that she had no ambition to run again. Habeck then made his intentions clear a few days ago.\nHe explicitly thanked Baerbock when addressing delegates after her on Sunday.\n\"It's a great privilege to know you're ahead of me, by my side and behind me,\" Habeck said to Baerbock.\nBaerbock, meanwhile, lauded Habeck as \"super pragmatic,\" saying he had managed to keep a steady course and free Germany from its dependence on Russian energy imports amid the crisis posed by Moscow's invasion of Ukraine, referring to policies that in some cases have angered parts of the party's ecologist base.\n\"Nobody can handle the rudder like Robert Habeck in a storm and at the same time set the sails correctly in a tailwind,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nOn Saturday, the opening day of the conference, the pro-environment party also appointed a new party leadership duo: multilingual foreign policy specialist Franziska Brantner and 35-year-old Felix Banaszak, a former co-chair of the party's youth wing who only joined the federal parliament after the last election in 2021.\nThe Greens briefly led in the polls early in the 2021 campaign, but slipped drastically to finish a distant third, with 14.7% support, as Scholz's Social Democrats made a late surge which put them ahead of their traditional rivals, the Christian Democrats.\nmsh/dj (AFP, dpa, Reuters)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

The environmentalists are aiming to remain in government.\nThere was no time for nostalgia or looking back in anger, as Germany's Greens pivoted into campaign mode at their weekend party conference in Wiesbaden.\nGermany is expected to elect a new federal parliament on February 23, seven months earlier than expected, following the collapse of its governing coalition of the Greens, the neoliberal Free Democrats (FDP) and the center-left Social Democrats (SPD), on November 6.\nBut the Greens, a former protest party, do not want to give up hope of being a ruling power as part of a new coalition. Party leaders have spoken of taking responsibility for the country in difficult times — even if that may mean having to enter a coalition with the conservatives of the Christian Democrats (CDU) and Christian Social Union (CSU), who are currently far ahead in opinion polls.\nVice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck was elected as the Greens' lead candidate on Sunday, with 96% of the vote. In his acceptance speech, Habeck said democracy was threatened by divisions in society, by right-wing extremism and populists. adding that it was yet to be seen what the election of Donald Trump as the new US president would mean for Germany's security. In this dramatic situation, also considering the wars in Ukraine and the Middle East, the Greens were needed more than ever, according to Habeck.\n\"Germany's answer to the growing strength of authoritarian regimes is not more nationalism, rather an alliance of democrats in a European Union which is strong and in touch with its citizens,\" he said in reference to the success of populist parties in Germany.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Greens are starting this election campaign with their backs to the wall.

Several weeks ago, the former co-leaders, foreign affairs expert Omid Nouripour and Bundestag lawmaker Ricarda Lang, announced their resignation in response to hefty defeats in recent elections — especially the European Parliament elections in June, when the Greens' vote share dropped from 20.5% at the 2019 election to only 11.9%.\nOn Saturday, the party voted in new co-leaders Felix Banaszak, a Bundestag legislator from North-Rhine Westphalia, and Franziska Brantner, who served as state secretary in Habeck's Economy Ministry. Banaszak received 93% of delegates' votes, Brantner about 78%.\nBrantner, 45, a social scientist, is in Habeck's inner circle. Her election is proof that the Greens' national campaign will be very much tailored around the lead chancellor candidate.\nForeign Minister Annalena Baerbock, the party's top candidate in the 2021 election campaign, expressed interest in keeping her position even after the snap election. The aim is to defend the country and democracy against threats from within and without, above all, right-wing extremists and populists, she told party delegates.\n\"Our responsibility as a progressive party is now, above all, to give security, to protect what is dear and sacred to us,\" she said. Baerbock also claimed that the enemies of democracy, progress and freedom played on people's insecurities by \"badmouthing Germany every day.\"\nGuest speaker Luisa Neubauer, Germany's most well-known climate activist from the Fridays for Future movement, reminded the Greens not to forget their key issue of combating climate change in their quest for power.\n\"If you do not honestly and clearly name what is happening in terms of the climate crisis and what still needs to be done in the matter of climate justice, then everyone else will hide behind it.\" she said.\nShe called on Habeck's team to engage in \"a real climate election campaign that nobody else is doing otherwise.\"\nThe Greens also want to address the housing shortage and renew the country's ailing infrastructure. These are all projects the center-left coalition had resolved to do, but could not implement.\nThe Greens have clearly switched into election campaign mode. \"Given the situation in the world, the crises and conflicts, Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine, we would have liked more responsibility for the continuation of this alliance,\" Britta Hasselmann, the Greens' parliamentary leader in the Bundestag, told DW. \"But now we are looking ahead.\"\nThis sentiment is also driven by the almost 10,000 new members the party has gained since the government broke down on November 6, giving the Greens a membership of about 140,000. Despite this, it would be a massive feat of strength for the party of environmental protection to remain part of the government after February 23.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Investigators also accuse the suspect of publishing Nazi images and slogans.\nA 64-year-old from Bavaria is under investigation for allegedly posting antisemitic images and slogans online, but also for allegedly insulting Deputy Chancellor Robert Habeck in a separate post.\nThe public prosecutor's office in Bamberg in northern Bavaria confirmed on Friday that the suspect's flat had been searched, with a tablet device being seized, and that the Green party's candidate for chancellor in upcoming elections had asked authorities to prosecute an alleged insult against him.\nThe 64-year-old suspect is accused of posting an image of Habeck on the X social media site formerly known as Twitter earlier this year.\nHe captioned the photo with a phrase that could be translated multiple ways in English, with one strong option being \"professional idiot\" — with the German \"Schwachkopf\" literally translating as \"weak-head.\" The man also appeared to be trying to allude to an advertising campaign by the similarly-named hair care company Schwarzkopf Professional.\nHabeck authorized prosecutors to pursue the case for the insult against him by issuing what in German is known as a \"Strafantrag.\" However, this is different from an individually-submitted criminal complaint to law enforcement authorities known as a \"Strafanzeige,\" and could indicate that law enforcement had first invited or asked Habeck to press the charges. Prosecutors did not specify who had approached who first.\nThe Bavaria resident is also accused of posting Nazi-era imagery and language earlier in 2024. According to prosecutors, this post may have violated German laws against the incitement of ethnic or religious hatred.\nThe man was arrested on Thursday as part of nationwide police operations against suspected antisemitic hate speech online.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAt least in theory, any political officials in Germany — all the way from the chancellor to the municipal level — can press charges against perceived public insults, if they think they can demonstrate reputational harm or an impact on their ability to carry out their role.\nIf convicted, perpetrators can face a fine or up to three years in prison.\nThese \"insults\" are not to be confused with demonstrably false libel or defamation cases, which are covered in a separate law and can carry a longer sentence of up to five years in the extreme.\nA similar law protecting foreign heads of states and diplomats from insult came under major scrutiny several years ago when Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan tried to use it to prosecute many people in Germany, including prominent comedian Jan Böhmermann, for criticisms leveled against him.\nThe uproar over that case led to the law's abolition, but its cousin affording protection to German politicians remained. It was also amended in 2021, primarily to reword it to make clear that online communications could also qualify.\nmsh/ab (AFP, dpa)"

    "content": "The Greens are set to confirm Robert Habeck as their top candidate, elect two new party leaders and map out a course to continue promoting their progressive agenda.\nIn the midst of very turbulent times, around 800 delegates from Germany's Green Party are meeting in Wiesbaden from November 15-17 for a party conference where they hope to reinvent themselves.\nRobert Habeck, the vice chancellor and economy minister in the minority government of Chancellor Olaf Scholz, is expected to be elected as the Greens' top candidate in the campaign.\nHabeck told DW that the convention will be a forum to look ahead, rather than back. \"First of all, we have to talk about what is happening right now. All the crises, conflicts, and challenges: Why is there so much conflict?\"\nHe stressed that the Greens need to focus on the country's most pressing problems, such as the creation of more affordable housing and making electricity and heating cheaper. The Greens will focus on these topics no matter whether they end up in government or in opposition, Habeck said.\nThe center-left coalition of Social Democrats (SPD), Greens and the neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) collapsed on November 6 after three years in office and months of infighting about the 2025 budget. The ongoing conflicts in the government over climate action and social and economic policy were a source of frustration, and there has been much discontent among the Green's base when they voted to tighten asylum and migration policies.\nAfter the early election scheduled for February 23, the Greens may well find themselves in the opposition again. However, Habeck has said he is not giving up hope of getting more than the 11% of votes, a result indicated by the most recent polls.\n\"All the disputes, all the compromises that we had to make are now gone. And now the parties are stepping forward with their own ideas. Now a lot can change on all fronts,\" said Habeck.\nSince the breakup of the coalition government, he pointed out, there has been a real sense of euphoria within the party, which has been reflected in a major influx of new members. Some 5,500 people have reportedly joined the Greens since the government fell apart, giving the environmental party 130,000 members — a new record.\nIndeed, Habeck has been extremely popular throughout his political career. The philosophy major authored several books, joined the Green Party in 2002 and went on to become lawmaker and then agriculture minister in his northern home state of Schleswig Holstein.\nHabeck had a very favorable image with voters at the beginning of his term in office in 2021, with approval ratings much higher than those of the taciturn Chancellor Scholz. After the start of Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine, it was Habeck who found simple and heartfelt words to explain the impact of rising energy prices and inflation to the German people.\nBefore 2018, Habeck was a co-chair of the Green Party alongside current Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, but stepped aside to allow her to be candidate for chancellor in the 2021 election campaign. Following Baerbock's campaign, the Greens garnered 14.8% of the vote, which made them the third-largest party behind the Social Democrats and center-right Christian Democrats.\nBaerbock announced weeks ago that she would not be seeking the top job in the next election. She is expected to support Habeck in this campaign.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter poor showings in several recent elections, including in the European elections in June and in the three eastern German states in September, the party's leaders threw in the towel. Co-chairs Omid Nouripour and Ricarda Lang do not plan to run again for the party leadership.\nFelix Banaszak and Franziska Brantner are now expected to replace them.\nBanaszak, 35, is a junior member of the Bundestag from Germany's most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia. He hails from a working class family — his grandfather migrated from Poland to the Ruhr Valley, West Germany's former industrial heartland.\nBrantner, 45, is a political scientist who was born and raised in Heidelberg. She spent time in Tel Aviv and Washington, and has been a member of the lower house of parliament since 2013.\nShe currently serves as state secretary in the Economy Ministry, and is said to be a close confidante of Habeck. Her candidacy has drawn the attention of Habeck's critics within the party. They accuse Habeck of seeking to force the party to toe his line and adopt his more pragmatic, centrist approach that encompasses a wide range of issues, in an attempt to appeal to people who have not previously voted for the Greens.\nIn an interview with the national daily Süddeutsche Zeitung, Brantner admitted that she is faced with a difficult mission: \"It's a big task, but one that reflects the times we live in.\"\nBoth candidates have made it clear that under their leadership, the Greens would once again focus on climate action. With Donald Trump as president, the US could no longer be counted on as a key partner for climate protection.\nHabeck is probably the Green Party's best-known politician. But he lost a lot of support during his time in the government due to his poorly communicated plans to switch German homes from gas to sustainable heat pumps.\nThe short election campaign leading up to February's election is likely to focus on him. However, not everyone is pleased with this, as many members of the Green Party see themselves as a party based on a political platform, not one in which personality is all that important.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Baerbock also claimed that the enemies of democracy, progress and freedom played on people's insecurities by \"badmouthing Germany every day.\"\nGuest speaker Luisa Neubauer, Germany's most well-known climate activist from the Fridays for Future movement, reminded the Greens not to forget their key issue of combating climate change in their quest for power.\n\"If you do not honestly and clearly name what is happening in terms of the climate crisis and what still needs to be done in the matter of climate justice, then everyone else will hide behind it.\" she said.\nShe called on Habeck's team to engage in \"a real climate election campaign that nobody else is doing otherwise.\"\nThe Greens also want to address the housing shortage and renew the country's ailing infrastructure. These are all projects the center-left coalition had resolved to do, but could not implement.\nThe Greens have clearly switched into election campaign mode. \"Given the situation in the world, the crises and conflicts, Putin's war of aggression in Ukraine, we would have liked more responsibility for the continuation of this alliance,\" Britta Hasselmann, the Greens' parliamentary leader in the Bundestag, told DW. \"But now we are looking ahead.\"\nThis sentiment is also driven by the almost 10,000 new members the party has gained since the government broke down on November 6, giving the Greens a membership of about 140,000. Despite this, it would be a massive feat of strength for the party of environmental protection to remain part of the government after February 23.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "One of three parties in Chancellor Olaf Scholz's governing coalition discussed plans to pull out two months before the government fell, German media have reported. Germany now faces a snap election in February 2025.\nGermany's neoliberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) plotted to collapse Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition government two months before it fell apart, two German newspapers reported on Saturday.\nThe revelations come as the country prepares for a snap election in February, following the firing of FDP Finance Minister Christian Lindner earlier this month. Lindner's widely reported plan to lower taxes, scrap recent reforms and roll back environment protection targets was deemed a provocation by his left-leaning coalition partners, and his party decided to pull out of the coalition. The coalition then collapsed on November 6.\nHowever, the alliance between the FDP, Scholz's center-left Social Democrats (SPD) and the environmentally friendly Greens had been unsteady for more than a year due to ideological differences and disputes over the government budget.\nDie Zeit and Süddeutsche Zeitung cited several sources as saying the FDP had drawn up a plan during secret talks in Potsdam in September to break away from the three-party coalition.\nLindner, who was fired by Scholz from his post as finance minister after months of wrangling over the 2025 budget, attended the talks, along with several other FDP government ministers and officials in the party's parliamentary faction, Die Zeit reported.\nTop of the agenda, according to the newspapers, was the future of the German coalition government and the future of the FDP.\nDie Zeit said what was discussed over the next few hours was \"the beginning of the end of the traffic light government,\" referring to the colors of the three parties: green, red, and yellow. The FDP officials reportedly drew up the first outlines of \"the script for the overthrow of the government,\" known internally as the \"D-Day project.\"\nThe original D-Day marked the landing of Allied troops in Normandy, France in June 1944, marking the beginning of the end of World War II and Germany's then-Nazi regime.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSeveral scenarios were reportedly developed by the party's top leadership over the next two months, who eventually produced a detailed plan to exit the coalition.\nDie Zeit said an economic policy paper was even drawn up, which the party knew would be unacceptable to the other coalition partners, who had been wracked by months of infighting.\nA timetable for the withdrawal of FDP ministers from the Cabinet was also discussed, the newspaper reported.\nThe FDP was at the time polling below 5%, a crucial threshold for any party to enter the lower house of parliament, the Bundestag.\nParty officials were also concerned the FDP could disappear into obscurity for the second time in a decade. Between 2009 and 2013, the party was a part of former Chancellor Angela Merkel's coalition, but then dropped below the 5% threshold and was left without seats in the national parliament.\nAccording to Die Zeit, Lindner made it clear that he saw no hope for the party if it remained in government.\nResponding to the revelations, an FDP spokesperson told DPA news agency: \"We do not comment on internal meetings.\"\nThe spokesman added that assessments about the party's future in the coalition had taken place \"repeatedly and in various rounds,\" ever since Germany's Constitutional Court declared the coalition's 2021 supplementary budget unconstitutional last November.\nThe supplementary budget was designed so Scholz's government could move €60 billion ($63.25 billion) in unused COVID pandemic recovery funds to bolster its climate and infrastructure investments.\n\"Of course, scenarios were considered again and again and opinions were gathered,\" the FDP spokesman said.\nThe spokesman continued that Lindner had proposed two options to Scholz at a meeting earlier this month.\nThese were \"an agreement on a realignment of economic policy or the orderly termination of the coalition through a joint path to new elections,\" he added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAfter Lindner was dismissed on November 6, the same day Donald Trump was reelected as US president, two of the three remaining FDP ministers in the federal government walked out, while another quit the party.\nThis left Scholz leading a minority government, prompting calls for a confidence vote in the government and an early election.\nAhead of February's likely federal vote, most pollsters are already predicting a grand coalition between center-right CDU/CSU — Merkel's former alliance — and Scholz's SPD as likely.\nThe FDP is currently polling at 4%, according to a survey published Saturday by the INSA polling institute for Germany's largest mass circulation daily, Bild.\nmm/dj (DPA, Die Zeit)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Environmentalists have fought expansion for months and call authorities dishonest.\nOn Monday, police in Grünheide, Germany, began the task of removing environmental activists from a forest encampment near the site of Tesla's new gigafactory outside Berlin.\nProtesters are against further expansion of the electric carmaker's factory, pointing to the deforestation this would require, as well as raising serious concerns about the amount of water the facility will require for the production of batteries, and what this would mean for local drinking water supplies.\nAuthorities have informed activists in a protest camp in the forest surrounding the factory that they will be allowed to return as soon as the site is searched for unexploded WWII bombs and deemed safe.\nThe camp went up in February and partially overlaps land already approved for building.\nA Potsdam police spokesperson reiterated the claim that the operation was not about clearing the protest camp but solely about ensuring that no bombs were present.\nTwo such explosives were found onsite this summer and dealt with in controlled detonations.\nOn Monday, police said they would remove protesters after they refused to leave on their own last week, despite being offered a temporary alternative protest site. This meant authorities were forced to climb up into treehouses, according to police.\nPolice representatives did not say whether the protest camp will be dismantled when the area is searched.\nThose involved in the protest say old bombs pose no threat under normal circumstances, and that they would present a danger only during future construction, accusing authorities of being dishonest in their intent.\nMoreover, protesters accuse authorities of having no intention of respecting the wishes of local citizens, who voted against a further expansion.\nTesla, which is owned by Elon Musk, the world's richest man, has said it plans to double production at the site to manufacture one million cars annually.\nOn October 15, Brandenburg's Ministry of the Environment approved a partial expansion of the site.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\njs/jsi (AFP, dpa)"

    "content": "Pakistan has grown its solar energy capacity by an astounding amount in a remarkably short space of time. The shock surge has given residents the power to survive blackouts, but it threatens to disrupt the grid.\nA solar surge has reached new heights in Pakistan, sparking what some experts are calling one of the fastest solar revolutions in the world.\nThanks to cheap Chinese solar technology imports, Pakistan is expected to add an estimated 17 GW of solar power in 2024, which is more than a third of the country's entire generating capacity.\nThe surge is \"probably the most extreme\" case \"that has happened in any country in the world with the speed that has happened,\" according to energy analyst Dave Jones, who tracks the global energy transition at think tank Ember in the UK.\nThis growth places Pakistan as one of the top installers of solar panels globally for 2024, in the company of much bigger, richer economies like China, the US and Germany, Jones' team found.\nCountrywide, consumers, businesses and industries are rushing to tap into the cheap renewable power source as an alternative to the erratic and expensive state-provided, largely fossil-fuel-based energy.\nPakistan's unreliable power grid, compounded by under-supply and poor infrastructure, means that millions of people live in constant uncertainty. Many households around the country have also been crippled by soaring energy prices over the past three years, inflated by high oil and gas prices post Putin's invasion of Ukraine, an over-investment in thermal power plants and government subsidy cuts to meet International Monetary Fund loan conditions.\n\"It's come to that point now that, for daytime electricity, it is a no-brainer for people in Pakistan to go out there and to be doing this on the scale that they're doing it,\" Jones said.\nIt is unclear exactly how much of the total imported solar capacity will be installed in 2024, as government records cannot keep pace with the speed of the consumer-led transition. But for homes across the country, the energy switch is already making a difference.\nWhen Shafqat Hussain's mom nearly died during a 28-hour power outage at their family home that coincided with a heatwave, he decided it was time to harness the power of the thing that almost cost his mother her life: The sun.\n\"There is no alternative in this country,\" said Hussain, who lives in central Islamabad with his three children, his wife and his parents.\nHis mom's experience — she spent two days in the hospital recovering from heatstroke after suffering inside on a scorching summer's day without electricity — was the catalyst for him to install solar panels on his rooftop. His colleague recommended he buy from a local company that was importing the panels from China.\n\"When you don't have any electricity, forget about the air conditioning. Your fans are not working. You don't have refrigerators on. You don't even have any cold water to drink,\" said Hussain, who described the electricity blackouts as continuously disruptive but especially concerning during summer months.\nHis family's energy bill has since been slashed by about 80%, and they haven't endured a power outage since. They now revel in a newfound \"sense of safety,\" said Hussain.\nThe boom puts Pakistan on a better pathway to achieve its goal of 60% renewable energy by 2030. But the mass solar upswing hasn't been without complications.\nAs increasing numbers of people use solar power to meet their own energy needs during the day, the sudden drop in demand is causing problems for operators of the main national electricity grid.\n\"The way those power plants were planned and funded was to run a minimum amount of hours,\" said Jones. Because they're no longer meeting those minimum hours, the electricity they do provide is becoming significantly more expensive for the remaining consumers, Jones explained.\n\"It's also causing problems for balancing the grid more generally,\" he added, as operators are struggling to predict how much energy they will need to provide and when.\nJones warned that if the government perceives the consumer-led solar boom as too disruptive, it could cut the surge short.\n\"What really risks happening in Pakistan now is that you have a blanket ban on any more solar coming in,\" he said.\nPakistan's solar revolution is only possible because of the plummeting cost of solar PV modules, which have reduced in price by 90% in the last 15 years alone. Most cheap solar panels are sold by China, the world's number one manufacturer of solar PV modules.\nOver four decades, solar power has gone from being one of the most expensive, out-of-reach electricity sources to just about the cheapest in most places around the world.\nPakistan is not the only country tapping into the cost-saving clean alternative. Throughout 2024, Jones' team at Ember tracked high numbers of Chinese solar exports to Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, the United Arab Emirates, Thailand, South Africa and Oman.\n\"It is transformative and it's affordable,\" said Azeem Azhar, author, tech entrepreneur and founder of research group Exponential View, who likens the exponential drop in the cost of solar technology to the PC revolution of the 1980s.\n\"What we saw then was an expansion of computing across our economies and the democratization of that particular technology,\" said Azhar.\nThe next frontier in Pakistan's energy transformation will be battery storage, predicts Azhar.\nWhile solar panels can generate power during the day, batteries will enable households to store energy for nighttime use.\n\"We haven't yet got the price of batteries down far enough to rely on battery backup. But that will happen in the next few years. Batteries are really, really coming down in price,\" said Azhar.\nThis article was adapted from an episode of DW's Living Planet podcast.\nListen to the audio version here."

    "content": "Bashar al-Assad's last public appearance as president was last Sunday, when he met Iran's foreign minister in Damascus\nBashar al-Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow and been granted asylum \"out of humanitarian considerations\", Russian news agencies are quoting a Kremlin source as saying.\nRussian state TV also reported the news, which put an end to speculation about the whereabouts of Syria's former president after rebel forces seized control of Damascus.\nEarlier, the Russian foreign ministry had announced that Assad \"decided to resign the presidency and left the country, giving instructions for a peaceful transfer of power\".\nRussia, which has two key military bases in Syria, is a staunch ally of Assad and had intervened in Syria's 13-year civil war in an effort to keep him in power.\nBut it was unable to stop the collapse of his government in the face of a lightning rebel offensive that took advantage of his other key allies, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, being distracted by other conflicts.\nSyria's Assad falls - follow live updates\nWatch: BBC sees looting at Bashar al-Assad's residence\nSteve Rosenberg: Fall of Assad is a blow to Russia's prestige\nHTS leader not only player in Syria's fast-changing future\nWhere is Bashar al-Assad?\nAssad has not been pictured since he met the Iranian foreign minister in Damascus a week ago. That day, he vowed to \"crush\" the rebels seizing territory with dizzying speed.\nEarly on Sunday morning, after their fighters entered the city without resistance, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies declared that \"the tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled\".\nWith no official confirmation from the Syrian presidency, military or state media, rumours swirled about Assad's whereabouts.\nThe head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported that a plane believed to be carrying Assad \"left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left\" the facility. Rami Abdul Rahman said he had information that the plane was meant to take off at 22:00 (20:00 GMT) on Saturday.\nPeople also followed flights in and out of Damascus to work out when Assad might have left and where he might have gone.\nReuters news agency cited two unnamed senior Syrian army officers as saying that Assad had boarded a Syrian Air plane at Damascus airport early on Sunday.\nIt noted that a Syrian Air Ilyushin Il-76T cargo plane took off from the airport at 03:59 local time (01:59 GMT) with an undisclosed destination.\nAccording to data from Flightradar24, the plane initially flew towards the Mediterranean coast, which is a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and is also home to two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.\nBut after flying over Homs, the plane made a U-turn and started flying eastwards again while also losing altitude. The plane's signal was lost at around 04:39 (02:39 GMT), when it was about 13km (8 miles) west of Homs and flying at an altitude of only 1,625ft (495m).\nSyria in maps\nBBC in Umayyad Square amid deafening gunfire\nWatch: Presidential palace stormed in Damascus\nIt was not clear what happened to the plan, but Flightradar24 said the aircraft \"was old with an older transponder generation, so some data might be bad or missing\", that it was \"flying in an area of GPS jamming, so some data might be bad\", and that the aircraft tracker was not aware of any airports in the area where the signal was lost. There were also no reports of any plane crashes.\nData from Flightradar24 also showed that a Russian military plane took off on Sunday from Latakia's international airport, next to Hmeimim, and flew to Moscow. Once again, it was not known who was on board.\nAs well as reporting the arrival of Assad in Moscow, Russian state TV said Russian officials were in contact with representatives of \"the Syrian armed opposition\" and that they had guaranteed the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic missions.\nRussia insisted its air strikes only targeted \"terrorists\" during its nine-year air campaign in support of Assad, but they regularly killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure.\nThe SOHR said in September that more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, had been killed in Russian military operations.\nWho are the rebels in Syria?\n'No-one slept in Syria last night' - how news of Assad's toppling spread\nWhat just happened in Syria?\nEnd of Assad rule will reshape region's balance of power\nCrowds gather in Damascus after rebels declare city 'free'\nSouth Korea parliament votes to impeach president\nUK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes\n'I felt like a breathing corpse': Stories from people freed from Syria torture prison\nThe dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspect\nQuestions over Andrew's judgement and finances raised again\n'I wasn't me any more' - a photographer tackles her postnatal depression\n'Train phone snatcher stole Â£21,000 from my bank apps'\nWhat lies ahead for Assad and his family?\n'It's life limiting': Living with a diagnosable hatred of fidgeting\nGirl group Flo: 'British R&B acts struggle to be heard'\nWeekly quiz: Which film bagged the most Golden Globe nominations?\nTrump says Syria 'not our fight'.

    "content": "Allison Pearson\nEssex Police has defended its actions after Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson said she was left âdumbstruckâ by a visit to her home on Remembrance Sunday over a social media post.\nOfficers visited Pearson as part of an investigation into alleged incitement to racial hatred, following a complaint from a member of the public, the force said.\nIn an article, Pearson said she was told by the police who came to her home it was over a ânon-crime hate incidentâ, but not told which post it was about.\nThe force said âat no stageâ did its officers tell her the investigation was related to a ânon-crime hate incident\".\nA non-crime hate incident is where no criminal offence has been committed but the person reporting it believes the incident to be motivated by hostility.\nIn a statement, Essex Police said officers âwent to a residential address to arrange a time to do an interview with a woman about a complaint made by a member of the publicâ.\nâAt no stage during the short interaction between the woman and our officers was she informed that the report being investigated was being treated as a non-crime hate incident. To suggest otherwise is wholly inaccurate and misleading.\nâAs the public would expect, we have body worn video of this interaction which entirely supports our position in this respect.â\nEssex Police later released what it said were transcribed lines spoken by an officer in the body worn video, which the BBC has not seen. It says the officer stated that the complaint had \"gone down as an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online\".\n\"Because of whatâs been alleged and the evidence that weâve got, I need to just ask you some questions,\" the officer also says.\nWarning: This article contains language that some people may find offensive\nIn her article, Pearson said that when police visited her, she did not know what post on X that the complaint was about, but that \"a year ago, I was consumed with the aftermath of the Oct 7 attacks by Hamas\" and slogans brandished at pro-Palestinian marches.\nThe BBC has seen the now-deleted post that the police complaint relates to, which dates from 16 November last year. It shows an image of two police officers standing next to two men holding what appears to be a flag of the Pakistani political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nThe post tags the Metropolitan Police alongside the words âhow dare theyâ.\nIt adds: âInvited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.â\nX added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it is ânot related to Palestineâ.\nPearson said that when police turned up at her house last Sunday morning, she was shocked.\n\"I was definitely shocked. Astonished. That too. Upset. How could I not be?â she said, adding that she felt âa surge of instinctive anger. A non-crime - what the hell?â\nThe force has since lodged a complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) regulator over the Telegraph's reporting of the incident.\nThe BBC has been told by the Met Police that the original complaint was made by a member of the public on 18 November last year.\nThe force said it was contacted on social media by a member of the public âwho wished to make an allegation that a post on X was a possible hate crimeâ.\nIt added that the allegation was recorded but not investigated, and then passed on to Sussex Police on 22 November last year, as the complainant lived in that county. Sussex Police then passed it to Essex Police, where she now lives.\nA number of political figures have come out in support of Pearson, including shadow home secretary Chris Philp and former prime minister Boris Johnson - and a debate has been sparked around free speech.\nMP Richard Tice, deputy leader of the Reform UK party, told the BBC the Telegraph columnist had been left \"terrified and scared\" by the police visit.\nHe also called on the chief constable of Essex Police to apologise to Pearson or risk bringing the force into disrepute.\nThe Home Office has already been looking into how forces review non-crime hate incidents in balance with the right to free speech.\nA spokesman for the prime minister's office said: âUltimately it's important that the police can capture data relating to non-crime hate incidents... to help prevent serious crimes which may later occur.\nâThis must be balanced with the fundamental right to free speech and also ensuring that the police can spend their time dealing with the issues that matter most to our communities.\"\nThe BBC has contacted The Daily Telegraph for comment.\nEssex Police said it supports free speech but \"it does not support inaccuracy\".\n\"If an alleged crime is reported, it is investigated. There is no public interest in falsehood.\"\nSouth Korea parliament votes to impeach president\nUK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes\n'I felt like a breathing corpse': Stories from people freed from Syria torture prison\nThe dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspect\nQuestions over Andrew's judgement and finances raised again\n'I wasn't me any more' - a photographer tackles her postnatal depression\n'Train phone snatcher stole Â£21,000 from my bank apps'\nWhat lies ahead for Assad and his family?\n'It's life limiting': Living with a diagnosable hatred of fidgeting\nGirl group Flo: 'British R&B acts struggle to be heard'\nWeekly quiz: Which film bagged the most Golden Globe nominations?\nTrump says Syria 'not our fight'.

It meanders west to east across the Atlantic, where areas of high and low pressure are created.\nAn active jet stream like this one means weâve had lots of areas of low pressure directed to the UK - and if itâs particularly powerful, the result is more storms.\nThe\nlonger range forecast for December, January and February suggests the jet stream\nwill stay more active than not, which means overall wetter, windier and milder\nweather.\nIt means there's a greater chance of more storms to come over the next few months.\nÂ© 2024 BBC.

    "content": "What options are left for the refugees increasingly terrified of Israel’s war on Lebanon?\nBeirut, Lebanon – On November 10, Sudanese asylum seekers gathered to listen to Abdel Baqi Othman in a cafe in Lebanon’s capital Beirut.\nThe well-respected Sudanese activist spoke passionately about how Sudanese asylum seekers were trapped between the civil war in their homeland and Israel’s invasion of Lebanon.\n\n\n\n\nHe implored the UN refugee agency (UNHCR) to relocate registered Sudanese asylum seekers and refugees to Italy, Turkey or Cyprus until their asylum applications could be processed, or until they could be permanently resettled elsewhere.\nIn the crowd was Abdelmoniem Yahiya Othman, who held a sign that read, “No racism, no social violence. Stop killing civilians and children,” a plea against the myriad spectres threatening people in the region.\n“We know the UN can distribute refugees and asylum seekers to different [safe] countries, but they are not doing anything,” he told Al Jazeera.\n“We want to go to a place where the people are not at war.”\nThe war in Sudan between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) erupted in April 2023.\nThe conflict has since killed tens – maybe hundreds – of thousands of people and generated the largest humanitarian crisis in the world.\nUNHCR said 400 Sudanese nationals have applied for asylum in Lebanon since the war in Sudan began. Yahiya, a 38-year-old man with stubble around his chin and dark shadows under his eyes, is one of them.\nAs a “non-Arab” (the name used for the sedentary tribes) from Sudan’s Darfur, he fears he could be persecuted from both sides in the war based on his ethnicity.\nThe RSF – a group largely made up of “Arab” (nomadic) tribes from Darfur and elsewhere – has targeted non-Arab communities, leading to credible accusations of ethnic cleansing and genocide.\nThe army, meanwhile, has arrested, tortured and even killed civilians from Darfur out of suspicion they’re spying for the RSF, according to a report by local and international rights groups and a team of researchers from the School of Oriental and Asian Studies.\n\n\n\nGiven the danger in Sudan, Yahya felt safer in Lebanon until Israel escalated its war against the country in late September.\nYahiya and his wife Nokada were working on a farm in the southern governorate of Nabatieh when Israel began carpet-bombing Lebanon. His employer fled, ordering the couple to stay and protect the farm.\nWithout a car to escape in or a shelter to run to, Yahiya and Nokada endured several terrifying days as bombs lit up the night sky and they struggled to sleep.\n“At night, I would see Israel fire missiles and drop cluster bombs from the air… so scary. I remember watching them break off into little fragments and fall all around us,” Yahya said.\nTen days later, he and his wife decided to head to Beirut on foot. They walked for days, stopping at villages along the way, where they stayed with friends and peers to rest.\nThey trekked at least 30km (19 miles), passing a long line of cars stuck in traffic, sometimes having to climb over piles of rubble from damaged homes.\n“I remember seeing people get out of cars [because traffic wouldn’t move] and just begin walking, as well,” he told Al Jazeera.\nWhen they finally reached Sidon, a city about 44km (27 miles) from the capital, they hitched a ride with Syrian and Sudanese people heading to Beirut.\nIn Beirut, Yahya and Nokada went to the only place that would accept them: The Sudanese Cultural Club in the bustling neighbourhood of Hamra.\nTucked away on a side street, the Sudanese Cultural Club was established in 1967 as a social place for a community that has long suffered from racial discrimination in the country.\nThe club is tucked away behind a wall of green trees and bushes. The roomy interior has two large living rooms, two toilets and a basic kitchen.\nA large Sudanese flag hangs on the wall, facing several well-used comfy sofas and wooden tables.\nFor years, the Sudanese community gathered there to celebrate holidays, attend cultural events, socialise and eat meals together. In the back room, Sudanese men would play cards, smoke and drink tea all night.\nSince Israel’s invasion, the club has sheltered displaced Sudanese nationals, along with other migrant workers in the country.\nYahiya says more than 100 people had taken refuge in the club in October. While many moved on, Yahiya and Nokada are still there, along with several other families.\n\n\n\nSometimes being there is not comfortable, he said, due to tensions over the lack of space and toilets but the displaced people cooperate to cook, clean and take care of each other.\nYahyia is thankful to have a refuge but knows that the club is only a temporary solution.\nThis is why he supports the community’s call to be evacuated to a safe third country while their asylum claims are processed.\nMost asylum seekers escape the threat of persecution or war to seek refuge in a nearby country.\nThere, they register at the nearest UNHCR office, often waiting years until the agency decides whether to confer refugee status.\nOnly some asylum seekers are recognised as refugees and even fewer get resettled to a third country to begin a new life.\nThis means most will spend their lives in the country they initially claimed asylum in, grappling with poverty, a lack of opportunities and, often, abuse from local authorities.\nDespite their ordeal, though, refugees and asylum seekers generally remain relatively safe from the threats in their homeland – but those in Lebanon do not feel safe as Israel’s assault continues.\nAccording to the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), there are about 11,500 Sudanese nationals in Lebanon. Of this number, 2,727 are registered as refugees and asylum seekers, according to UNHCR.\nMany, about 541, are counting on Othman and other community leaders calling for an evacuation.\n“[T]he UNHCR says that it doesn’t evacuate. That’s not true and they’re lying to us. It’s a scandal,” Othman told Al Jazeera.\nHe referenced the evacuations UNHCR oversaw from Libya, where more than 2,400 asylum seekers and refugees were relocated to Rwanda on 19 evacuation flights between 2019 and 2024.\nThose evacuations were made possible thanks to a memorandum of understanding signed between UNHCR, the African Union and Rwanda, according to UNHCR.\nHundreds more were temporarily relocated to Italy via a humanitarian corridor established by community-based groups, who fully sponsored the asylum seekers, in cooperation with the UNHCR, whose role was identifying vulnerable asylum seekers and refugees and facilitating their travel.\nSince 2017, a total of 12,000 asylum seekers and refugees have been evacuated from Libya due to the abuse and exploitation they face from fighter groups and traffickers, according to UNHCR, rights groups and experts.\n\n\n\nBut the agency may be reluctant to advocate for more evacuations, according to Jeff Crisp, an expert on asylum and migration at the University of Oxford and former head of policy and development at UNHCR.\n“My guess is that UNHCR is very wary of setting up additional evacuations because it will set up a domino effect whereby refugees across the world will begin requesting [temporary] evacuations,” Crisp said.\nHe believes the lack of a permanent framework to help asylum seekers trapped in a war is a gap in international refugee protection,  given that host countries are not always safe.\n“[N]ow you have situations – like in Libya or Lebanon – where refugees and asylum seekers are caught up in very vicious conflicts,” he added.\nDalal Harb, UNHCR spokesperson in Lebanon, told Al Jazeera the evacuations from Libya were “responses to a specific crisis and were not intended as permanent frameworks”.\n“The feasibility of replicating such operations depends on various factors, including the willingness of third countries to host evacuees, available resources and the specific circumstances of the crisis,” she said in an email.\nYahya is unconvinced.\n“We need UNHCR to evacuate us,” he said. “We know the agency has the power to redistribute asylum seekers and refugees to other countries.”\nHarb said UNHCR is urging Western governments to quickly relocate recognised refugees awaiting resettlement from Lebanon.\n“This includes Sudanese as well as refugees of other nationalities,” her email read.\nAccording to Othman, many asylum seekers and refugees will likely resort to smugglers if they can afford them.\nSmugglers often put vulnerable people on overcrowded dinghies and push them in the direction of Europe – many have arrived in Cyprus from Lebanon in recent years, but others have drowned.\nDespite the risks, Othman warned, more and more Sudanese asylum seekers will look for any route out of Lebanon if the situation deteriorates.\nHowever, Yahya says most asylum seekers do not have the money to escape. Those who do, he claims, pay anywhere between $2,000 and $3,000 to reach Turkey via Syria.\nFor now, Yahya said Sudanese asylum seekers are praying God takes care of them while they remain in Lebanon.\n“We worry that the situation here could get worse,” he said. “But we don’t have money…we have no choice but to rely on the UNHCR.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "In Pictures\nPolitical violence marred Mexico’s elections this year. And in Venezuela’s presidential race, protests accompanied a contested result and widespread allegations of electoral fraud.\nBut in Uruguay on Sunday, a much more muted presidential election unfolded.\nLocated on the southern Atlantic coast, north of Argentina, Uruguay was one of several Latin American countries holding high-stakes presidential elections this year.\nAnd unlike some of its counterparts, critics say Uruguay serves as a model for democratic stability in the region.\nSunday’s election was a run-off, pitting the top two presidential contenders from the October 27 general election against one another.\nThe early favourite was Yamandu Orsi, the candidate for the left-wing Broad Front coalition. In the October vote, he notched 44 percent support — well short of the 50 percent needed to avoid a run-off.\nComing in second place on October 27 was Alvaro Delgado of the ruling National Party, a conservative group.\nWhile he only received 27 percent of the vote in the first round, he is likely to benefit from the 20 percent of voters who cast their ballot for the third-place candidate, fellow conservative Andres Ojeda of the Colorado Party.\nBoth Orsi and Delgado advanced to Sunday’s run-off with strong support, making the outcome a nail-biter.\nOrsi, a 57-year-old history teacher, has the support of former President Jose Mujica, a former leftist rebel fighter who survived torture under Uruguay’s military dictatorship in the 1970s and ’80s.\nMujica has since become a beloved figure on the left: He was dubbed the “world’s poorest president” during his time in office, from 2010 to 2015, for his humble lifestyle.\nOrsi’s Broad Front coalition was in power until the 2019 election, which saw the rise of the conservative National Party. It was the first conservative victory in nearly 15 years.\nBut outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou is prevented by law from seeking a second consecutive term. Running instead for his party is the 55-year-old Delgado, a former veterinarian.\nBoth Delgado and Orsi have emphasised strengthening Uruguay’s economy.\nOrsi, who campaigned with the slogan “We know how to achieve”, has emphasised measures to raise wages for low-income workers. Delgado, meanwhile, has focused on streamlining Uruguay’s bureaucracy and forging trade deals with partners like China.\nBoth men have pledged to respect the results of the election and work together, no matter the outcome.\n“We must value what we have: democratic coexistence,” said the head of the Broad Front coalition, Fernando Pereira.\nMeanwhile, Ojeda — the third-place candidate knocked out in the first round of voting — remarked to local media about the calm accompanying Uruguay’s election.\n“If I had brought a foreigner here and I didn’t tell him that there was an election, he wouldn’t have noticed,” Ojeda said.\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "The probe, slated to be released Friday, has been left in limbo after Gaetz resigned his role as House representative.\nThe leading politician in the United States House of Representatives, Speaker Mike Johnson, has resisted calls to release a report examining allegations against Matt Gaetz, President-elect Donald Trump’s choice to be attorney general.\nThe report, led by the House Ethics Committee, examined accusations that Gaetz, 42, had inappropriate sexual relations with a minor and engaged in illicit drug use.\n\n\n\n\nUS media had indicated the report was slated to be released on Friday, just two days after Gaetz resigned from Congress.\nOn Friday, Johnson, a fellow Republican, told reporters that his recommendation was to keep the report unpublished, citing Gaetz’s resignation as a reason.\n“I’m going to strongly request that the Ethics Committee not issue the report because that is not the way we do things in the House,” said Johnson.\nBut Democrats quickly slammed the speaker’s decision. Hakeem Jeffries, the minority leader of the House, quoted the adage that “sunlight is the best disinfectant”.\n“In a democracy, transparency is always the best course of action, particularly when it relates to high-ranking government officials,” Jeffries said, signalling his support for the report’s release.\nAs Trump’s pick for attorney general, Gaetz is slated to lead the Department of Justice and serve as one of the highest-ranking law enforcement officers in the country.\nBut allegations of sexual misconduct have fuelled the controversy surrounding Gaetz’s nomination for the post: The Justice Department itself launched a nearly three-year investigation into Gaetz, though it ultimately chose not to pursue charges.\nGaetz faces what is expected to be a contentious Senate confirmation proceeding in 2025 to decide whether his nomination will pass.\n\n\n\nIn April 2021, just months after the Justice Department probe began, the House Ethics Committee started its own investigation into Gaetz’s behaviour.\n“The Committee is aware of public allegations that Representative Matt Gaetz may have engaged in sexual misconduct and/or illicit drug use, shared inappropriate images or videos on the House floor, misused state identification records, converted campaign funds to personal use, and/or accepted a bribe, improper gratuity, or impermissible gift,” a press release at the time read.\nGaetz, however, has denied any wrongdoing. Like Trump, he has accused rivals in the government of weaponising the justice system against him.\n“I believe that there are people at the Department of Justice who are trying to criminalize my sexual conduct, you know, when I was a single guy,” he told the publication Axios in March 2021.\nIn nominating Gaetz to head the Justice Department on Wednesday, Trump cited their shared view that the legal system had been wielded against them. The president-elect also pledged “desperately needed reform”.\n“Matt will end Weaponized Government, protect our Borders, dismantle Criminal Organizations and restore Americans’ badly-shattered Faith and Confidence in the Justice Department,” Trump said in an online statement.\n\n\n\nGaetz’s resignation from the House, in the aftermath of his nomination on Wednesday, brought the Ethics Committee’s work to an end.\nThe committee is charged with investigating possible ethics violations among sitting House members. Now that Gaetz is no longer a representative, its findings have been left in limbo.\nOn Friday, House Speaker Johnson cited those limitations in his decision not to push for the report’s release.\nHe added he planned to urge House Ethics Committee Chairman Michael Guest not to provide the Gaetz report to the Senate Judiciary Committee.\n“The rules of the House have always been that a former member is beyond the jurisdiction of the Ethics Committee,” said Johnson.\n“I think it’s a terrible breach of protocol and tradition and the spirit of the rule,” he added. “I think that would be a terrible precedent to set.”\nJust hours earlier, Johnson had returned to Washington, DC, after a trip to visit President-elect Trump at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He and Trump have been pushing for party unity in 2025, as Republicans prepare to take control of the White House and the Senate, in addition to the House.\n\n\n\nGaetz, however, has been a controversial pick for a cabinet-level position, even among Republicans.\nIn 2023, for instance, Gaetz spearheaded an effort to unseat former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, resulting in a weeks-long impasse over his replacement.\nCritics also say he has minimal experience to qualify him for a cabinet-level position. Already, some Republican senators have expressed doubt about his viability for the role.\n“I don’t think it’s a serious nomination for the attorney general,” Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told US media. “I’m looking forward to the opportunity to consider somebody that is serious.”\nIn order to take up the role, Gaetz would need to be confirmed by the Senate, where Republicans are slated to have a majority of 53 seats out of 100.\nDemocrats are also pressuring their colleagues in the Senate to make the Gaetz ethics report public. On Friday, US Representative Steny Hoyer told reporters that he believes the Senate would be in its right to request the report before voting on Gaetz.\n“Certainly the Senate has the authority to ask for it, and I frankly think the House ought to produce it. After all, this is a critical issue that the Senate has to address,” Hoyer said.\nHe added he was “deeply disappointed” by President-elect Trump’s choice for the attorney general role.\n“I don’t know how many times this has happened in history, where a nominee for the attorney general of the United States, the chief of law enforcement of the United States, would have the ethical and legal issues that this nominee has had,” Hoyer said.\n“This is a historic issue.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "The left-wing Broad Front candidate emerged victorious in a tight race against governing-party candidate Alvaro Delgado.\nYamandu Orsi, the candidate for the left-wing Broad Front coalition, is projected to emerge victorious in Uruguay’s run-off election for the presidency.\nHe bested Alvaro Delgado of the ruling National Party to win the tightly fought race, though public opinion polls showed the two candidates in a dead heat in the lead-up to Sunday’s vote.\n\n\n\n\nOrsi’s supporters took to the streets in the capital of Montevideo, as the official results started to show the former mayor and history teacher surging ahead.\nMany waved the party banner: a red, blue and white striped flag with the initials FA for “Frente Amplio”, which translates to “Broad Front”.\n“Joy will return for the majority,” the coalition posted on social media as Orsi approached victory. “Cheers, people of Uruguay.”\nOrsi’s win restores the Broad Front to power in the small South American country, sandwiched on the Atlantic coast between Brazil and Argentina.\nFor 15 years, from 2005 to 2020, the Broad Front had held Uruguay’s executive office, with the presidencies of Jose Mujica and Tabare Vazquez, the latter of whom won two non-consecutive, five-year terms.\nBut that winning streak came to an end in the 2019 election, with the victory of current President Luis Lacalle Pou, who led a coalition of right-leaning parties.\nUnder Uruguay law, however, a president cannot run for consecutive terms. Lacalle Pou was therefore not a candidate in the 2024 race.\nRunning in his stead was Delgado, a former veterinarian and Congress member who served as a political appointee in Lacalle Pou’s government from 2020 to 2023.\nEven before the official results were announced on Sunday, Delgado had conceded, acknowledging Orsi’s victory was imminent.\n“Today, the Uruguayans have defined who will hold the presidency of the republic. And I want to send here, with all these actors of the coalition, a big hug and a greeting to Yamandu Orsi,” Delgado said in a speech as he clutched a large Uruguayan flag in his hand.\nHe called on his supporters to “respect the sovereign decisions” of the electorate, while striking a note of defiance.\n“It’s one thing to lose an election, and another to be defeated. We are not defeated,” he said, pledging that his right-wing coalition was “here to stay”.\nThe outgoing president, Lacalle Pou, also reached out to Orsi to acknowledge the Broad Front’s victory.\n“I called [Yamandu Orsi] to congratulate him as president-elect of our country and to put myself at his service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it pertinent,” Lacalle Pou wrote on social media.\nOrsi had been considered the frontrunner in the lead-up to the first round of the elections.\nOriginally from Canelones, a coastal regional in the south of Uruguay, Orsi began his career locally as a history teacher, activist and secretary-general of the department’s government. In 2015, he successfully ran to be mayor of Canelones and won re-election in 2020.\nIn the 2024 presidential race, Orsi – like virtually all the candidates on the campaign trail – pledged to bolster Uruguay’s economy. He called for salary increases, particularly for low-wage workers, to grow their “purchasing power”.\nHe also called for greater early childhood education and employment programmes for young adults. According to a United Nations report earlier this year, nearly 25 percent of Uruguay’s children live in poverty.\nBut the economy was not the only issue at the forefront of voters’ minds. In a June survey from the communications firm Nomade, the largest share of respondents – 29 percent – identified “insecurity” as Uruguay’s “principal problem”.\nThat dwarfed the second-highest ranked topic: “Unemployment” was only picked by 15 percent of respondents.\nAs part of his platform, Orsi pledged to increase the police force and strengthen Uruguay’s borders, including through the installation of more security cameras.\nAs he campaigned, Orsi enjoyed the support of former President Mujica, a former rebel fighter who survived torture under Uruguay’s military dictatorship in the 1970s and ’80s.\nMujica remains a popular figure on Uruguay’s left, best known for his humble living arrangements that once earned him the moniker of the “world’s poorest president”.\nIn the first round of voting, on October 27, Orsi came out on top, with 44 percent of the vote to Delgado’s 27 percent. But his total was far short of the 50 percent he needed to win the election outright, thereby triggering a run-off.\nThe race got tighter from there forward. Only two candidates progressed to the run-off – Delgado and Orsi – and Delgado picked up support from voters who had backed former Colorado Party candidate Andres Ojeda, a fellow conservative who was knocked out in the first round.\nNevertheless, Orsi quickly pulled ahead after the polls closed for the run-off election on Sunday.\n“The horizon is brightening,” Orsi said in his victory speech. “The country of freedom, equality and also fraternity triumphs once again.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "Left-wing Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva says poverty and hunger the ‘product of political decisions’.\nLeaders of the Group of 20 major economies have called for “comprehensive” ceasefires in Gaza and Lebanon, while also stressing the need for cooperation on climate change, poverty reduction, and taxing the ultrarich.\nThe economic forum met in Rio de Janeiro on Monday as leaders sought to shore up multilateral consensus on issues of concern amid heightened global tensions and United States President-elect Donald Trump’s return to the White House in January.\n\n\n\n\nUkraine dominated the agenda on day one of the two-day summit after Washington gave Kyiv the green light to strike Russian territory with long-range missiles supplied by the US.\nIn their final declaration, G20 leaders eked out a narrow consensus on Ukraine, welcoming “all relevant and constructive initiatives that support a comprehensive, just, and durable peace”, while again condemning the “threat or use of force to seek territorial acquisition”.\nIt, however, made no mention of Russian aggression.\nWith an International Criminal Court arrest warrant obliging member states to arrest him, Russian President Vladimir Putin was not in attendance. Instead, Russia was represented by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\nThe G20 leaders also called for a “comprehensive” ceasefire in Gaza, in line with a US-proposed United Nations resolution urging a permanent halt to fighting in return for the release of all captives held by Hamas.\nTheir statement expressed “deep concern about the catastrophic humanitarian situation” in the Palestinian enclave.\nIt also expressed concern over the “escalation in Lebanon” and called for a ceasefire enabling “citizens to return safely to their homes on both sides of the Blue Line”, a demarcation line dividing Lebanon from Israel and the occupied Golan Heights.\nLeft-wing Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has made extreme poverty and hunger a focus of the summit, with the group’s final statement endorsing cooperation on effectively taxing “ultra-high-net-worth individuals”.\nLula, who grew up in poverty, earlier opened the summit by unveiling a global initiative aimed at tackling poverty and hunger, emphasising that such challenges are “not the result of scarcity or natural phenomena” but the “product of political decisions”.\nEighty-one countries signed the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty – which is also backed by multilateral banks and major philanthropies – including 18 of 19 G20 nations.\nArgentina, led by right-wing President Javier Milei, was the only G20 country not to support it.\nArgentina also partially dissented from several points in the G20’s final declaration, including content related to the UN’s previous 2030 sustainable development agenda, which Milei has referred to as “a supranational programme of a socialist nature”.\nLula’s opening speech also highlighted the widespread impact of climate change.\nThere was no climate breakthrough in the final declaration, however, as leaders merely recognised the need for “substantially scaling up climate finance from billions to trillions from all sources”.\nThey did not stipulate who would provide the funds, but agreed on the need to set a goal for how much money rich nations should give poorer ones by the end of the UN’s COP29 climate change summit in Azerbaijan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

A no-confidence motion requires at least 288 of 574 votes to pass.\nThe far-right National Rally (RN) of three-time presidential candidate Marine Le Pen is expected to vote for the motion put forward by the left, giving it enough numbers to pass.\nThe session is due to start at 4pm (15:00 GMT), with voting expected hours later. President Emmanuel Macron is set to return to France from a state visit to Saudi Arabia during the day.\n\n\n\nMacron, whose term ends in 2027, has dismissed the threat of his potential removal from office amid the turmoil, saying such discussions were “make-believe politics”.\n“I’m here because I’ve been elected twice by the French people,” Macron was quoted as saying by French media. “We must not scare people with such things. We have a strong economy.”\nBut the toppling of the Barnier government after just three months in office would leave the president with few options over how to go forward and who to appoint in his place.\nNo new elections can be called for a year after the previous legislative polls. Macron could ask Barnier to stay on in a caretaker role as he seeks a new prime minister, which could happen only next year.\nAsked on French television if there was a chance his government could survive Wednesday’s vote, Barnier replied: “I want this and it is possible. It depends on the MPs,” he said.\nThe latest political turmoil follows snap elections called by Macron in June in a bid to halt the surge of the far right, which left no party or faction in parliament with a majority.\nSome observers have suggested that Le Pen, 56, is seeking to bring down Macron before his term ends by ousting Barnier. The far-right leader is embroiled in a high-profile embezzlement trial and, if found guilty in March, could be blocked from participating in France’s next presidential election in 2027.\nShe has insisted that the party’s stance was entirely due to a budget that would make the French poorer. “Censuring the budget is for us the only way the constitution gives us to protect the French,” Le Pen told reporters as she arrived in parliament.\nIf the government falls, it would be the first successful no-confidence vote since a defeat for Georges Pompidou’s government in 1962, when Charles de Gaulle was president.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "Follow:\nLast year was the hottest on record, oceans boiled, glaciers melted at alarming rates, and it left scientists scrambling to understand exactly why.\nThey know the extraordinary heat was fueled by a number of factors, predominantly planet-heating pollution from burning fossil fuels and the natural climate pattern El Niño. B﻿ut those alone did not explain the unusually rapid temperature rise.\nNow a new study ﻿published Thursday in the journal Science says it has identified the missing part of the puzzle: clouds.\nTo be more specific, the rapid surge in warming was supercharged by a dearth of low-lying clouds over the oceans, according to the research — findings which may have alarming implications for future warming.\nIn simple terms, fewer bright, low clouds mean the planet “has darkened,” allowing it to absorb more sunlight, said Helge Goessling, a report author and climate physicist at the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany.\nThis phenomenon is called “albedo” and refers to the ability of surfaces to reflect the sun’s energy back into space.\nThe Earth’s albedo has been declining since the 1970s, according to the report, due in part to the melting of light-colored snow and sea ice, exposing darker land and water which absorb more of the sun’s energy, heating up the planet.\nLow clouds also feed into this effect as they reflect away sunlight.\nThe scientists scoured NASA satellite data, weather data and climate models and found the decline in low clouds reduced the planet’s albedo to record lows last year. Areas including parts of the North Atlantic Ocean experienced a particularly significant fall, the study found.\nLast year fits into a decade-long decline of low cloud cover, Goessling told CNN.\nRelated article\nThis controversial climate solution could be exactly what the planet needs. Or it could be a colossal disaster\nWhat the study can’t yet explain for certain is why this is happening. “This is such a complex beast and so hard to disentangle,” Goessling said.\nHe believes it is likely the result of a combination of factors. The first is a reduction in shipping pollution due to regulations aimed at reducing the industry’s harmful sulfur emissions. While this has been a win for human health, this type of pollution was also helping cool the planet by brightening clouds.\nNatural climate variabilities, including changing ocean patterns, may also have contributed. But Goessling points to a third, more alarming factor: global warming itself.\nLow-level clouds tend to thrive in a cool and moist lower atmosphere. As the planet’s surface heats up, this can cause them to thin or dissipate entirely, setting up a complicated feedback loop where low clouds are disappearing because of global warming, and their disappearance then drives further warming.\nIf this is happening, future warming projections may be underestimated and “we should expect rather intense warming in the future,” Goessling said.\nMark Zalinka, an atmospheric scientist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory who was not involved in the study, said “the fact that clouds play a key role in the story makes sense, as they essentially act as Earth’s sunscreen.”\nSmall changes in cloud cover can “drastically change Earth’s albedo,” he told CNN.\nTapio Schneider, a climate scientist at the California Institute of Technology, said the worrying implication of the research is if global warming is responsible for a substantial amount of cloud cover change, “we may see stronger global warming than previously predicted.”\nClouds may seem simple, even mundane, but they are endlessly complex and scientists remain far from unraveling how they behave. They are “one of the biggest headaches” in climate science, Goessling said.\nBut figuring out how clouds will respond to global warming is key, Zalkina said. “It literally determines how much future warming is in store.”\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

    "content": "Follow:\nThe high price of bread and eggs doomed her. Nope, it was raw racism and sexism. Well, maybe she should have gone on Joe Rogan’s show.\nIf you’re looking for a reason why Vice President Kamala Harris lost to Donald Trump, there are plenty to choose from. Many of Harris’ reeling supporters are still trying to understand the forces behind Trump’s win. Trump won less than half of the popular vote, where his margin of victory was smaller than President Biden’s in 2020. Still, he swept all seven swing states and he has forced Democrats to ask what they must do to reach more working-class and Latino voters.\nOne prominent evangelical pastor offers some insight. The Rev. William J. Barber II has long been one of America’s most persistent and eloquent spokespersons for poor and working-class Americans. Barber, who has been called “the closest person we have to MLK” in contemporary America, has organized coalitions of the poor, working-class Whites and people of color around such causes as raising the minimum wage, expanding health care and strengthening unions. Barber is the recipient of a MacArthur “genius grant” and helps lead the Poor People’s Campaign, which seeks national solutions to ongoing poverty.\nBarber also has done something else: He’s shown Democrats how they can win political victories in red states. Barber is currently the founding director of the Center for Public Theology and Public Policy at Yale Divinity School and Repairers of the Breach, a group that trains social justice leaders.\nBut he made his mark from his home state of North Carolina. As one of the architects of the “Moral Mondays” movement, he helped lead a racially diverse coalition that is credited with toppling a Republican governor and turning North Carolina into a swing state. Though Harris lost North Carolina, Democrats in 2024 won races for governor and attorney general, and the GOP appears likely to lose its veto-proof majority in the state legislature.\nFor Democrats debating how best to reach new voters, Barber’s perspective could be valuable. He has written a blueprint for expanding the Democratic base in North Carolina and elsewhere through what he calls “fusion politics,” a multiracial and multiclass coalition that transcends the conservative-vs.-progressive binary. Racism is often depicted as a Black problem, but Barber insists it’s also been used throughout US history to hurt the economic interests of everyday White people. He once said, “Racism may target Black people, but it damns a democracy, and it damns humanity.”\nCNN spoke with Barber about the country’s future in Trump’s impending second term. In his rumbling preacher’s baritone, Barber explained why he thinks both political parties fail the working class, how the Democratic Party can move forward and why he still believes America can become a genuine multiracial democracy.\nHis answers were edited for clarity and brevity.\nWere you shocked by the election results?\nI don’t know if shocked is the word. I’m deeply concerned for this country. I’m deeply disappointed that you could have someone who spews as much violence and viciousness, a sexual abuser (a federal jury found last year in a civil case that Trump sexually abused a woman in 1996 in New York City) who clearly doesn’t believe in the rule of law. He lies, curses and creates an enemy list. If Vice President Harris had done a half of one of those things, her poll numbers would have dropped and she would have not even been able to stay in the race. Trump is able to do it, and somehow so many Americans look the other way.\nFor people to say they still support him, there’s something deeply wrong with a large section of the country. And then what’s really shocking to me is the number of people who still choose not to vote. What is it about our society that we can see someone who leans into fascism, and there is not an all-out effort to get to the polls and say no?\nWhat’s your answer to that question? What is it about people that saw all this and still didn’t vote?\nI think people get turned off because they feel as though politics is just a game of the rich and things are not going to really change. From one study, we found out that 30 million poor and low-wage people did not vote because they said nobody talked to them. Nobody talked to their issues.  If you look at the two (2024 presidential and vice-presidential) debates, not one candidate was asked how would their policies affect the issues of people dying every day from poverty and low wages.  Not one candidate was asked would they raise the minimum wage, which we’ve not raised for 15 years.\nThe debates write a lot of people off. They (low-income viewers) don’t hear their names, they don’t hear their conditions. So our discourse, or lack thereof, is causing more and more people to just remove themselves (from the political process). We have a lot of questions to ask about our soul and mindset in this culture.\nCritics say Democrats are elitist and look down on working-class people. What do you say to that?\nNeither party has done enough, and all of them dismiss poor and low-wage service people in different ways. The Republicans tend to say poverty and low wage is your own fault. And then they try to racialize poverty and make it like it’s a Black issue. When they talk about poverty, the first thing they do is show a Black woman with food stamps.\nOn the other side, Democrats think that they can just talk “middle class.” They don’t have to say “poverty.” They don’t have to say “low wages.”  They fall in the trap of allowing poverty to be marginalized.\nDemocrats — I don’t know if I would use the word elitism — they just haven’t done what could have been done when they had the opportunity. I go back to the fact that the $15 (minimum wage) was a part of the Covid relief package. It was taken out of the package and it was allowed to be voted on individually but some so-called moderate Democrats said no to it at that time.\nWe have a deep moral problem in this country. We’re just writing off a whole swath of people. We begged and pushed and marched and demanded that there’d be a roundtable in the White House, bringing in poor, low-wage people from Appalachia and Alabama to face this issue. We said the Senate should have a vote on a living wage before the election and make people like (Vice President-elect) JD Vance vote and say where they stand right before the election so the American people could know. There’s not a battleground state where poor and low-wage people don’t make up more than 40% of the electorate. There’s not a battleground state where if just 10% of poor, low-wage people were to vote around an agenda that they wouldn’t fundamentally shift the outcome of the election.\nThere are people who say it’s a mistake to reduce Trump’s victory to racism or sexism because large numbers of Latino men voted for Trump. What role do you think racism and sexism played in the election result?\nRacism certainly is a part of it. But you got to go beyond just race because 66 million poor, low-wage folks are White, and they vote for policies that hurt them as well. You have to look at the level of chauvinism in the election. We’ve had two highly qualified women (Hillary Clinton in 2016; Harris in 2024), both better people (than Trump) in terms of character and policy, lose to Trump and the MAGA movement.\nIn North Carolina, you had a Democrat — the governor, the lieutenant governor, the superintendent of schools, the attorney general — win (in 2024).  And yet the vice president loses in North Carolina. That is not an easy thing to solve. The votes went down, rather than up, for both candidates (Harris and Trump). We know that extremists love election numbers to be down. That’s where they flourish.\nI talked to a Black woman who said after the election that she is done with America. She doesn’t want to live in this country anymore. What would you say to people who are in despair and just want to check out?\nThey should have a level of grief, hurt and anger to see someone who can be as fascist-leaning and mean-spirited, both in words and in public policy, as Trump beat someone who is upstanding and cares about the whole of all people.\nBut what you saw election night is not the whole of America. It’s a part of America in a particular moment around the election. You have to stop and say, wait a minute, this is the same America that I went to sleep in the night before. It’s not some strange America. This is part of America. America has always had multiple stories running at the same time.\nA democracy is a hard struggle. Sixty years after the end of the Civil War and the beginning of the first Reconstruction, you had something similar. An extremist got elected named Woodrow Wilson. He played “Birth of a Nation” (the 1915 silent film that featured racist depictions of Black people while glorifying the Ku Klux Klan, which Wilson screened at the White House). But the point I’m making is people were hurt. He lied to the Black community. He got elected, he started wanting to turn back all kinds of (civil rights) laws. The Supreme Court voted to begin separate but equal (the notorious “Plessy v. Ferguson” decision that legitimated Jim Crow laws). But what did people do? They hurt, they grieved and then they got up and fought.\nWe’re in the birth pangs of what I call a Third Reconstruction. We have to grab on to our foreparents. They didn’t have the luxury to go anywhere. It is not a moment to walk away. It is not a moment to say this is all of America. All of America’s voice wasn’t even heard (in this election). We can’t blame it all on Trump. If less people voted, we got to own that.  A democracy demands engagement. It’s built on “we the people.” Checking out is how extremists get elected.\nDo you still believe we could have a genuine multiracial democracy in America?\nOh, yes. I believe it. I think it’s hard work. We’ve had two attempts at reconstructing the country (Reconstruction in the 19th century and the civil rights movement of the 1950s and ‘60s). And remember: the reconstructionists didn’t just quit or lose. People were beaten down, cheated and assassinated. But I believe in the possibility of a Third Reconstruction. Out all of this grief and struggle we’ve seen, it’s going to cause a massive pushback. I know the history of folk who tend to wield injustice. They always go too far. And they end up producing their own resistance.\nMy word to progressives and Democrats is to not try to have a left or a right agenda. Have a moral agenda. Look at what issues are a violation of our deepest moral values. Lift from the bottom. Own the fact that the things we talk about — a living wage, health care — are highly popular in the public square.\nJohn Blake is a CNN senior writer and author of the award-winning memoir, “More Than I Imagined: What a Black Man Discovered About the White Mother He Never Knew.”\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

They could actually take Beau with them if they made the appropriate arrangements.\n“Within about six months of deciding that, we pulled the cord,” adds Greg, who previously worked as a project manager.\nRelated article\nFor some Americans living in Europe, relief from some of the smaller stresses of US life makes for a more relaxed existence\nChoosing the right place to relocate to wasn’t easy.\nEventually they narrowed it down to Singapore and Spain — two destinations they knew well, and could envision themselves living in.\nAfter weighing up the pros and cons of both, they settled on Spain, mainly due to its closer proximity to the US, which would mean a shorter flight for Beau, who had a heart issue.\n“It was one thing to get him to Europe,” says Gail. “But we don’t even want to be on a plane for 27 uninterrupted hours, let alone this poor guy.”\nConcluding that the Spanish city of Valencia, situated on Spain’s eastern coast, would suit them best, they arranged a trip there to “test it out.”\n“We’d never been there,” explains Greg, originally from Indiana. “And we wanted to see what it was like and make sure it was what we had read about, and seen on YouTube videos.”\nThe couple then began the process of arranging a non-lucrative visa, which allows non-EU nationals to live in Spain without working provided that they can prove that they have enough money to support themselves.\nThey’d originally planned to leave the United States in December 2018.\nBut Gail and Greg ended up bringing their move forward several months after a “very, very nice man behind the desk at the embassy” made it clear to them that once their visas were approved, they could head to Spain pretty much whenever they wanted.\n“We get back (from the Spanish embassy), and Greg’s like, ‘Guess I’m retiring a little bit earlier than I thought. I’ve got to make some phone calls.’” recalls Gail.\nThe couple quickly put their Florida home on the market and set about winding down their lives in the United States.\n“We did all the paperwork ourselves to file for permanent residency, sold two cars, our home, and 90% of our possessions,” says Gail.\nAs having a long-term rental contract was one of the requirements for their visa, they already had an apartment set up in Valencia.\n“The realtor walked us through it by video call,” Gail recalls. “And we were like, ‘OK, that’s fine.’”\nIn July 2018, Gail and Greg, who were in their mid-fifties at the time, “shut everything down in Florida” and jetted off to begin their new lives, bringing a few friends along for the journey.\nRelated article\n‘Too much grief and no joy’: This couple plans to return to the US after their dream life in France became a ‘nightmare’\n“About one week after I retired, we were on a plane over to Spain,” says Greg.\nOnce they arrived, the trio moved into a two-bedroom apartment in the “historic core” of Valencia and got themselves acquainted with their new surroundings.\n“I’d say, within two weeks easily, we had everything we thought we needed,” says Greg.\n“We had figured out where the grocery stores were and where the market was.”\nThe couple say they hired a mutual friend, who spoke fluent Spanish, to help them with tasks such as setting up a bank account.\n“The bank account was probably the most difficult,” says Greg. “But the need to speak the language is what makes it more difficult.”\nThey settled into life in Spain very quickly, and immediately noticed that the attitudes and priorities of their Spanish neighbors were very different to what they were used to back home.\n“I am constantly inspired by people’s ability to enjoy the moment,” says Gail. “And not be like, ‘Oh, if I work even harder, I can get a bigger car. Or, ‘If I work even more, I can get a bigger house.’\n“It is just not about that… Everything surrounding you is so absolutely beautiful, and you’re so ingrained in your community that it’s not about showing off.\n“It’s being content with what you have and really enjoying whatever the day brings you.”\nAs she’d studied Spanish for over a decade during her younger years, Gail hoped the language would come back to her over time.\nHowever, she found that she didn’t remember much more than “useless phrases” that popped into her head every now and again.\n“Some things I can rattle off perfectly,” she says. “And other things where, if I’m trying to respond to somebody in real time, it’s tricky. Then they walk away, and I’m like, ‘Oh, I know that.’”\nGreg has taken up padel, a hybrid of tennis and squash, which he says is “enormous” in Spain, since their big move and regularly plays with locals.\nAlthough he’s now retired, Greg has noticed that some of the other players will sometimes play in tournaments in the middle of a work day, which is something he can’t ever imagine happening back home.\nThis aspect of the laidback Spanish lifestyle suits them fine, but there’s one particular difference that Gail and Greg are still adjusting to –— the later lunch and dinner times.\n“In Valencia, the restaurants would not open until 2 p.m. for lunch,” says Greg. “We get up and have breakfast at 6:30 a.m or 7 a.m. in the morning and we can’t wait to eat that long.\nRelated article\nThis US couple relocated to Italy after retiring. It didn’t go according to plan\n“And then their dinner won’t start until about 8: 30 p.m. or 9 p.m…. We’re usually in bed by 10:30 p.m. So that’s way too late.”\nThey also admit that they’d gotten used to being able to get most things whenever they wanted when they were living in the US, and have to adapt to the idea of shops closing “For siesta”.\n“So if it’s 2 p.m. and you go, ‘Oh, we ran out of soap.’ Well, you’re waiting until 5 p.m., if the store even opens again,” says Gail.\nWhile they initially had private medical insurance, another requirement for their visa, the couple signed up for the Spanish public health service after a year in the country, and have been very impressed by the standard of care, as well as the lower costs.\n“I think the health care system here is so much better,” says Greg. “The quality of care is better. The cost is unbelievably less expensive.”\nGail goes on to recount how they misheard the price of Greg’s prescription when they visited a pharmacy, and asked the pharmacist if they could pay by card.\n“She kind of looked at me funny,” says Gail. “So she runs the card, and he gets the receipt and it was one euro and four cents, and he’d thought it was 104 euros.”\nOver the years, the couple say they’ve “basically formed a family composed of Spaniards and fellow expats from both the US and Canada as well as France.”\nAnd according to Gail and Greg, they have Beau to thank for many of the friendships they’ve developed while living in Spain.\n“Dogs just open up a whole different world…  We made so many dear friends, literally, just because of Beau,” says Gail.\n“Lots of people just can’t resist a cute dog. So either he would pull up to someone and we’d have a conversation, or they would come to him — because he’s so cute — and then the conversation was open.”\nRelated article\n‘It was a good choice: This US couple say their living costs dropped by nearly $3,000 a month when they moved to Italy\nSadly, Beau passed away in 2022.\n“He stuck around for a good three and a half years (after we moved,)” says Greg. “And I bet it (relocating) was easier for him than it was for us. He seemed more outgoing here than he was in the States.”\nOn reflection, Gail and Greg are very glad that they opted to move to Spain with Beau in tow rather than waiting it out.\n“I’m so thankful in so many ways, that we had him when we came over,” says Gail.\nAlthough the couple have both made learning — or re-learning in Gail’s case –— the language a priority, they still feel as though they’re not at the stage that they’d like to be.\n“I can understand a lot better than I can speak,” says Greg. “It’s taking me a lot longer than I ever thought it would to be able to speak it (Spanish) simply.”\nAfter five years in Valencia, Gail and Greg decided to move to Malaga City in the Costa del Sol, a region of Southern Spain.\nNow that they’ve lived outside of the US for so long, the couple say they can’t imagine ever moving back, and feel as though they were often on a “hamster wheel” before.\n“You don’t really realize how much of that is going on and how overt it is until you leave it,” says Gail. “And you’re like, ‘Why would you kill yourself like that?… It’s easy for us, from this vantage point, to see it.”\nSome of the Spanish people they meet can’t understand why they would ever leave the United States, and the couple say they believe that it’s actually “the perfect place to be” when you’re working.\n“It is a land of opportunity if you’re willing to sacrifice a lot,” says Gail, conceding that they made some “smart investments” along the way. “Yeah, I will give you that to this day.\n“We were just born there, so that was nothing but dumb luck. And we were opportunistic, so we took advantage of that. It is the last place we would want to be without having to work.”\nGail and Greg now consider Spain as “home” and say that the United States “felt like a foreign country” when they took their first trip back in 2023.\n“Just the crush of humanity that is around you all the time,” says Greg. “It seemed like everybody was in a rush.\n“And then that gets you tense, because you’re like, ‘Wait a minute. I’m sorry I’m in your way.’”\nHe says he can’t think of anywhere else in the world that appeals to him as much as Spain now.\n“I’d be very depressed if we had to move back to the US somewhere,” he says.\nGail was surprised to find that many of their relatives didn’t seem particularly interested in their lives in Spain, but says she’s thankful that they’re “happy where they are.”\n“They know our guest room (with a view of the Mediterranean) is always open to them,” she says.\nLast year, Gail, whose maternal grandparents were from Slovenia, hired a researcher to help track down some of her relatives, and has since traveled over to the country to visit.\n“I doubt that would have happened had we stayed in the US,” she says.\nEarlier this month, several areas of eastern Spain, including Valencia and Malaga, were impacted by extreme rain and flooding.\nGail and Greg hope to be able to volunteer to help those affected in the coming weeks.\n“The floods were horrific,” says Gail. “Fortunately our neighborhood was not impacted. However, we have friends in both Valencia and here in the city of Malaga that were not so fortunate.”\nThe couple say they’d advise anyone considering moving to a completely new destination to really throw themselves into the experience and accept that their lives likely won’t be the same as they were before.\n“The people that struggle the most are the ones that are, for whatever reason, just trying to replicate the life they had in the place that they left,” says Gail.\n“So it’s not that they’re actively shutting out traditions and the environment… But they just bitch about stuff…\n“Like, ‘I can’t find soft pretzels.’ And I’m like, ‘Why are you looking for things that don’t even exist here? Just go with it.’”\nGail and Greg couldn’t be happier with their new lives, but the couple do have one regret about leaving the United States and starting over in Spain.\n“For people who are sort of on the fence and thinking about it. Honestly, my only regret is that we didn’t do it earlier,” says Gail.\n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.  CNN Sans ™ & © 2016 Cable News Network."

    "content": "Follow:\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to strike Ukraine again with a new nuclear-capable ballistic missile following Moscow’s latest widespread attack on critical energy infrastructure.\nMore than a million households in Ukraine were left without power following the overnight bombardment, authorities in the country said Thursday. It’s Russia’s 11th large-scale assault on Ukraine’s energy supplies this year alone, according to the Energy Ministry in Kyiv, a strategy that has caused nationwide rolling blackouts.\nSpeaking at a security summit in Kazakhstan Thursday, Putin claimed the overnight attacks were a response to strikes on Russian territory using US-made ATACMS missiles. He also warned he would consider further launches of Russia’s new “Oreshnik” medium-range ballistic missile, first fired at Ukraine’s Dnipro region last week.\n“We will respond to the ongoing strikes on Russian territory by Western-made long-range missiles, including the possible continuation of the Oreshnik test in combat conditions,” he said.\nPutin also praised US President-elect Donald Trump, describing him as an “intelligent and experienced” politician capable of finding “solutions,” as tensions rise between Moscow and Kyiv’s Western partners.\nThe Russian leader claimed his forces hit 17 targets, describing them as “military facilities, defense industry facilities and their support systems,” without acknowledging the attacks on power infrastructure. “As I have said many times, there will always be a response from our side (to the use of American ATACMS),” Putin said.\nPutin, who has previously said that Moscow considers itself entitled to use weapons against military targets belonging to countries that allow their weapons to be used against Russia, also threatened further strikes.\nRussia’s Ministry of Defense is “selecting targets for hitting on Ukrainian territory,” he said. “These could be military facilities, defense industry enterprises or decision-making centers in Kyiv.”\nRussia’s use of the Oreshnik ballistic missile, which carries multiple warheads, last week marked a decisive, and potentially dangerous moment in Moscow’s conflict with the West, and may be the first time such a weapon has been used in war.\nPutin claimed the missile can get around air defense systems and if several warheads are used together, “the force of the strike will be comparable to the use of nuclear weapons.”\n“Everything that is in the epicenter of the explosion is divided into fractions, into elementary particles, essentially turning into dust,” Putin said, adding that the missile “has no nuclear charge.”\nThe Russian missile attack on Dnipro was not armed with nuclear warheads, but it used a weapon designed for nuclear delivery to instead launch conventional weapons.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the use of the new missile was “a clear and severe escalation in the scale and brutality of this war.”\nUkraine’s energy system came “under massive enemy attack,” overnight, Energy Minister German Halushchenko said Thursday. Bombardments have intensified in recent months, leaving Ukraine in a precarious position as the war grinds into its third winter.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said Russia used cluster munitions in the attack. The weapons, which disperse numerous small bombs over a large area, “make it more more difficult for our rescuers and power engineers” to respond to strikes, Zelensky said.\nRelated article\nUkraine is relying on drones to hold back Russian advances. Troops on the frontline are fearing the worst\nIn the immediate aftermath, Ukraine’s energy operator introduced emergency power cuts in many regions, with large outages in the western regions of Lviv, Volyn and Rivne. It has since shifted back to implementing scheduled hourly power cuts.\nAt least five people were injured, including one in the central Vinnytsia region, two in the southern Odesa region, and two in the capital Kyiv, officials said. In Kharkiv, a missile struck a civilian business, according to military authorities.\nIn a statement Thursday, US President Joe Biden condemned the “horrific” attack, which he said “serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression.”\nAir defenses were activated across the country, with damage reported in 14 regions, according to the Ukrainian Interior Ministry. In Kyiv, residents took shelter in metro stations as an air raid alert for the combined missile and drone attack sounded for more than nine hours.\n“This morning I heard about three explosions,” Valeriy Dorotiy, a resident of Lutsk, in western Ukraine’s Volyn region, told CNN. He said he couldn’t tell if the blasts were from missiles or Ukrainian air defense interceptions. “After that, the power went out.”\nAbout 215,000 households in the Volyn region were temporarily without power, authorities said earlier.\n“I have a power bank for charging my phone, but I did not buy a more powerful station because I did not take it seriously that there would be such attacks and that missiles would reach us,” Dorotiy said, adding that it seemed Russia was concentrating on attacking eastern Ukraine instead. “But it did reach us.”\nKyiv resident Olha Vaynrikh, 32, told Reuters, “Our mornings begin with checking the phone to see if there is an air alert… We are indeed fed up with all of it.”\nRoman Turiy, a resident of the western city of Ivano-Frankivsk, told CNN that air raid sirens started at 6 a.m. time in his area. “Many missiles of the second wave were already flying toward our region. Around 8:17 a.m., I heard a very loud explosion over Ivano-Frankivsk… I also heard explosions further away in the region.”\nSeveral critical infrastructure facilities had been attacked, he later discovered.\nRelated article\nTrump’s national security adviser pick is weighing proposals to end the Russia-Ukraine war\n“I expected to be without power for three hours, but according to the new schedule, it looks like we will be without electricity for eight hours today,” Turiy said. “We all understand that every winter is getting harder.”\nThe onslaught involved about 100 drones and more than 90 missiles, according to Zelensky.\nThis comes after Russia launched a record 188 drones at Ukraine on Tuesday in a mass attack that damaged critical infrastructure in the west of the country, according to the Ukrainian Air Force.\n“Every attack like this proves that air defense systems are needed in Ukraine now, where they save lives, not at storage bases,” Zelensky added, urging allies to help his country increase its air defense capabilities.\nThis story has been updated with additional developments.\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

    "content": "Follow:\nAn 11-year-old girl was left fighting for her life and a 12-year-old boy died after falling into the ice of Washington Park Lake in Albany, New York, on Saturday. The boy was found dead at the scene, and the girl is in critical condition after falling in while trying to save him.\nThe call came into the Albany Police Department around 4:30 p.m. by a witness who reported that two children had fallen in the ice near the park’s lake house, the department said in a Facebook post on Sunday. First responders began arriving on the scene seven minutes later, the Times Union reported.\nResponding officers first located the girl, who they believe watched the boy fall into the ice and followed the same path across the lake in an attempt to save him.\nThe girl was rescued and treated at the scene before being transported to Albany Medical Center Hospital. She was listed in critical condition as of Sunday, according to a statement from North Albany Middle School.\nMembers of the New York State Police Underwater Recovery Team conducted a second search of the lake, where they recovered the body of the 12-year-old boy around 7:25 p.m.\nThere was also a specialized water unit with water rescue equipment dispatched to the scene, Albany Chief of Fire and Emergency Services Joseph Gregory told the Times Union.\nOfficers investigating the case believe the boy attempted to walk across the lake toward the lake house when the ice broke beneath his feet. The lake at Washington Park is approximately 1,600 feet long and 140 feet wide, according to the Washington Park Conservancy, with depths ranging from 6.6 to more than 11 feet.\n“All firefighters involved, they did a great job in the operation that we had there. We’re very proud for what they did,” Gregory said. “It was a tough operation for everyone involved.”\nIn a statement sent to CNN, Mayor Kathy Sheehan thanked first responders and recovery teams for their services and said that her thoughts were with the families of both children.\n“Yesterday was a tragic reminder of how dangerous any body of water can be, especially as the weather gets colder and thin ice forms,” Sheehan said. “I want to thank all of the first responders who worked tirelessly last night in an attempt to save two young lives, and I also want to thank the New York State Police Dive Team for assisting with recovery operations.”\nThe names of the children were not released due to their age, but the families of both victims were notified.\nNorth Albany Middle School issued a statement acknowledging the victims as two of their own.\n“Our hearts go out to the families of these students at this incredibly difficult time,” City School District of Albany Superintendent Joseph Hochreiter said in the statement. “This is a terrible tragedy, and we are grieving as a school community.”\nThe Albany school district is providing crisis services for students and school employees needing support after the accident, according to the school district. The services will be provided at North Albany Middle School and the elementary schools the two students attended.\nComments under the Albany Police Department’s post about the incident reflected walking on the ice of the Washington Park Lake is common among residents.\n“I bet there isn’t a one of us who grew up here in the Albany area who didn’t get brave 3 or 4 times during winters and try to walk across ice,” a commenter said.\nOne claimed they fell through the same spot years back, and said, “there should be a danger sign on the lake.”\n“Keep off the ice” signs were placed at the lake on Monday following the incident, according to CNN affiliate WRGB. The city of Albany and the Parks and Recreation Association decided to put them out “earlier than usual,” Mayor Sheehan told WRGB.\n“Typically, we put up signage when it’s safe to skate because we want people to assume that it’s not safe to be on the water at all,” Sheehan said.\nAccording to Gregory, fluctuating temperatures in the area has caused all ice surfaces to be unstable. Residents are also advised not to follow behind people who have fallen into the ice, the chief said.\n“If somebody falls through the ice, they should immediately dial 911 to start help,” Gregory told CNN. “Do no attempt to go out into the ice and rescue them. See what you can do. If you can throw them a rope or throw them a line and pull them in, that would be helpful, but certainly don’t go in and compromise your safety.”\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

    "content": "Markets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nFollow:\nSpirit Airlines filed for bankruptcy protection Monday, as mounting losses, unaffordable debt, increased competition for bargain-seeking airline passengers and the inability to merge with other airlines left it little choice.\nThe airline said it will continue to operate as it restructures its debt.\n“Guests can continue to book and fly without interruption and can use all tickets, credits and loyalty points as normal,” it said in a statement.\nAirlines and other companies in the United States frequently file for bankruptcy and emerge stronger on the other side of the process. Most major US airlines, including the three largest — American Airlines, United and Delta — have filed for bankruptcy at some point in the past 25 years.\nSpirit’s statement said that as a result of its bankruptcy and negotiations with existing creditors it will be able to emerge early next year with reduced debt and increased financial flexibility that will “position Spirit for long-term success and accelerate investments providing guests with enhanced travel experiences and greater value.” It added that the creditors had agreed to pump an additional $300 million into the airline to fund its operations through the bankruptcy process.\nBut it is also possible that Spirit (SAVE) will end up being bought by another airline or be forced to liquidate. Numerous airlines, including American, have had their assets purchased out of bankruptcy and merged with a different airline.\nSpirit’s filing disclosed that it has nearly 13,000 full-time and part-time employees, and another 8,000 independent contractors and temporary workers. It lists the US Treasury Department as its second largest creditor, with taxpayers on the hook for a $136 million balance on an unsecured loan. The loan was issued in 2020 and 2021 as part of a federal program that provided grants and loans to the nation’s airlines to keep them in business at the beginning of the pandemic when most air traffic ground to a near-halt due to health concerns. While most of the money was distributed as straight grants, there was a total of $21.2 billion loaned out to the nation’s airlines as well.\nIn recent years Spirit attempted two mergers, one with fellow bargain carrier Frontier Airlines and once with JetBlue Airways, which topped the offer from Frontier only to have its purchase blocked by a federal judge on antitrust grounds.\nSpirit is known for its very low base fares. Its average domestic round-trip economy fare so far this year is $136, not including taxes and fees, according to data from Cirium, an aviation analytics firm. That’s 61% lower than the US industry’s average, and 69% less than the average on the four major US airlines — American, United, Delta and Southwest.\nSpirit’s problems could lead to higher fares across the industry. Its low-fare model had prompted major airlines to also offer no-frills “basic economy” seats on their planes. If it is forced to scale back its schedule or cities that it serves, goes out of business or gets purchased by a larger airline, that pressure to offer lower fares will be reduced.\nA new deal to buy Spirit and merge it into a larger airline might not run into the same issues this time, given that its bankruptcy filing would raise the possibility of liquidation as an alternative. It is also possible that President-elect Donald Trump’s Justice Department, which enforces antitrust laws, might not be as opposed to corporate mergers as the Biden administration has been. Several deals that might have gone through in the past have been challenged on antitrust grounds in the last four years.\nSpirit said last week in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing that it is in “productive” negotiations with its lenders to restructure its debt, which comes due in 2025 and 2026. Its previous filings disclosed it had $3.1 billion in long-term debt on its balance sheet.\nAs a result of the bankruptcy filing, Spirit expects to be delisted from the New York Stock Exchange “in the near term,” it said Monday, adding that its common stock is expected to be canceled and have no value as part of the restructuring.\nSpirit’s shares plunged 59% Wednesday after it announced it was in talks with creditors and disclosed that it was unable to complete its third-quarter financial report by the prescribed time due to those negotiations. Shares of Spirit fell another 18% in trading Friday amid reports that the bankruptcy filing was imminent and have lost 93% of their value so far this year.\nSpirit was a pioneer in the US market in offering ultra-low base fares but charging extra for virtually all other options, including carry-on bags.\nBut that low fare model resulted in a large number of passenger complaints against Spirit, as well. Spirit and Frontier were the bottom two airlines in the most recent passenger satisfaction survey conducted by JD Power.\nIts low-fare model also led to concerns that a sale to JetBlue would lead to higher fares across the industry — concerns that resulted in the Justice Department’s antitrust case that blocked the deal.\nAll US airlines hemorrhaged billions of dollars during the first two years of the pandemic, despite receiving billions in federal assistance to keep flying and prevent widespread layoffs. But as demand for air travel bounced back in 2022, so did profitability at the larger carriers.\nSmaller carriers — like Spirit — that offered lower fares to attract bargain-hunting leisure travelers have continued to struggle. Spirit reported operating losses of $360 million in the first six months of this year, nearly four times the losses reported in the first half of 2023.\nThe airline has also taken several measures to raise cash and cut costs, recently announcing a sale of 23 of its Airbus jets and delaying future aircraft deliveries. The company also furloughed hundreds of its pilots, and it plans to cut additional staff in January.\nThis story has been updated with additional reporting and context.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "Markets\nHot Stocks\nFear & Greed Index\nLatest Market News\nHot Stocks\nFollow:\nX competitor Bluesky rocketed to the No. 1 spot on the Apple App Store’s US chart this week, as many users of Elon Musk’s platform said they were decamping in the wake of his significant role in the US presidential election.\nBluesky’s user base has doubled in the past 90 days — on Tuesday the company said it had gained 1 million new sign-ups in the past week alone, bringing it to more than 15 million total users.\nThe energy on X is markedly different: Musk spent months using the site to boost President-elect Donald Trump. In recent days, researchers have recorded surges in sexist language like “your body, my choice” on the site. And that’s on top of previous changes by Musk, like cutting moderators, restoring banned accounts, allowing racist and Nazi accounts and changing the platform’s verification system to boost anyone who was willing to pay, regardless of what they posted — all of which helped to tank the company’s core ad business.\nA number of prominent journalists announced their exit, accordingly, from X to join Bluesky this week, including the Atlantic’s Charlie Warzel, the New York Times’ Mara Gay and former CNN anchor Don Lemon. UK newspaper The Guardian also said Wednesday that it will no longer post to X from its official channels, calling X “a toxic media platform,” although it did not specify which other platforms it plans to use to promote its work.\nBut while Bluesky may be having A Moment three years after its launch, any claims that it will kill X should be taken with a grain of salt.\nAs a private company, X doesn’t share user numbers. Recent third party estimates of user trends are mixed, although the consistent user growth the platform enjoyed prior to Musk’s takeover does appear to have been upended in the past two years. But — for better or, probably, worse — the site has so far weathered the creation of multiple other competitors, the reinstatement of White supremacists and the spread of racist conspiracy theories from Musk down without fading into irrelevance.\n“X usage is at an all-time high and continues to surge,” X CEO Linda Yaccarino said in a post Wednesday. “To all of our users — of every interest, political party, and point of view — You will always have a place to engage and join the global conversation freely and safely.”\nMore than 115,000 US X users deactivated their accounts the day after the election, the largest single-day exit since Musk assumed control of the platform, according to digital intelligence platform Similarweb. And that included only users who deactivated through the website, not the mobile app.\nBut X also had its highest web traffic all year that same day, racking up 46.5 million visits on desktop alone, up 38% from the average of the preceding few months, Similarweb said. Bluesky also saw daily visits jump on Election Day and the day after to 1.2 million and 1.3 million, respectively, up from around 800,000 in the days before.\n“Whether there will be a measurable decrease in the audience for X as the result of politics remains to be seen,” David Carr, Similarweb editor of insights, news and research, said in a blog post Tuesday. But, he added, “X’s recent daily peak in US traffic doesn’t make up for the erosion in audience the service has seen over the past couple of years since Musk took ownership of the service.”\nSensor Tower, another market intelligence firm, found that daily active app users and time spent on X jumped on November 5 and 6 compared to the prior 30 days. But by November 10, X daily active users were relatively flat compared to just before the election, whereas Bluesky saw a 28% jump in users in the same period.\nRelated article\nTired of Elon Musk? Here are the Twitter alternatives you should know about\nStill, X has far more users than Bluesky, Sensor Tower noted. (Bluesky also remains much smaller than Meta’s Threads.)\nA third app data analysis firm, Apptopia, also told CNN that activity on X jumped significantly ahead of the election. It said X’s daily active users peaked days later, on November 9, before tapering off slightly. On Bluesky, daily users more than doubled from-mid October to the post-election week.\nHere’s the takeaway from all those numbers: X had a big jump in usage leading up to and on Election Day and the day after, but it appears to be waning. At the same time, Bluesky saw a surge after the election that looks to be continuing, although its overall user base is still relatively small.\nOf course, lots of people flock to all kinds of media during and around an election week. And it’s worth remembering that we’ve seen troves of users swear off X before in the wake of earlier Musk incidents, only for many of them to come trickling back to the platform.\nNonetheless, anecdotally, some prominent social media users say they’re now seeing more engagement with their posts — the thing users on these sites typically prize above all else — on Bluesky, despite having larger followings on X.\nEd Zitron, founder of media relations firm EZPR, told CNN he and others have remained on X “because there is a critical mass of readers on there and there is a virality to the content you post.”\nBut, Zitron said, “with how Bluesky is scaling right now, I don’t see how (X) stays dominant,” adding that he has 90,000 followers on X but “the actual engagement doesn’t seem to matching up.”\nNew York Times journalist Mike Isaac had a similar remark in a Bluesky post Tuesday: “real disorienting to go from twitter — where i do a post to 200k followers and get five favs — over to bluesky where a post gets like 200 favs immediately.”\nBut here’s the thing: Even if X was hemorrhaging users to Bluesky, there’s no sign Musk would care enough to do anything.\nAlthough Musk said when he acquired the platform that he wanted it to be a “politically neutral” digital town square, X took a sharp turn toward the right under his leadership, even before he began championing Trump and his MAGA movement. Musk made X the first mainstream social platform to restore Trump’s account after he was widely banned following the January 6, 2021, attack on the US Capitol, prompting other platforms to do the same. In the run-up to the election, Musk spread false and misleading claims about Trump’s competitor, Vice President Kamala Harris. The platform also reportedly pushed political and pro-Trump content on users, whether they wanted it or not.\nNow, X has become something of a hub for right-leaning social media users.\nRelated article\nElon Musk has met with politicians from at least 13 different countries: Here’s what he has talked about\nAnd by using the platform as a megaphone to promote Trump, Musk may have gotten the kind of return that he couldn’t even imagine when he bought Twitter for $44 billion two years ago: direct access to the US president.\nTrump announced Tuesday night that Musk will take on an official role in his administration, becoming one of two people to lead a new “Department of Government Efficiency” alongside Vivek Ramaswamy. Musk also joined a call between Trump and Ukranian President Vladimir Zelensky immediately following the election, presumably to discuss the country’s war with Russia, in which Musk’s Starlink has played a key role as a communication tool.\nAnd Musk’s personal wealth also jumped by $26.5 billion the day after the election, as investors hope his relationship with Trump will boost his companies’ fortunes.\nThat’s almost certainly worth plenty more than X’s declining ad revenue and any lost users in Musk’s mind.\n–CNN’s Liam Reilly and Matt Egan contributed to this report.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "Follow:\nMelinda Pratt’s Monday began like any other: waking up the kids, turning on the TV and making her morning coffee.\n“I had it on my news channel, and I heard the carrots thing, and I leaned to look at the TV, and the Bunny-Luv carrots were on the screen,” she said. “I stopped everything then, and I went straight to my refrigerator and saw that I had those carrots.”\nPratt was hospitalized with bloody diarrhea and vomiting in October.\n“Shortly thereafter, she was notified that she had tested positive for shiga-toxin producing E. coli, and was contacted and questioned by the health department, which confirmed she had eaten Grimmway Farms’ carrots prior to her illness onset,” according to a lawsuit filed Monday on Pratt’s behalf in the Kern County, California, Superior Court.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recently announced that an E. coli outbreak connected to bagged organic carrots sold under several brand names, including Bunny-Luv and the store brands for Kroger, Publix, Target, Trader Joe’s, Walmart, Wegmans and Whole Foods, has led to one death and over a dozen hospitalizations.\nAnyone who purchased the carrots is urged to avoid eating them. Instead, throw them away and wash any item or surface that might have come into contact with them using hot, soapy water.\nGrimmway Farms declined to comment on the pending litigation.\n“We are taking this matter seriously and conducting a thorough review of our operations consistent with our ongoing commitment to providing customers with safe, high-quality produce,” the company told CNN.\nThe type of bacteria involved in this outbreak is E. coli O121:H19, a strain of dangerous Shiga toxin-producing E. coli, which has been linked to ground beef, romaine lettuce and water in the past, the CDC says. Shiga toxin can penetrate and kill cells, causing tissue damage.\nAlthough most kinds of E. coli are harmless and can help with food digestion, others can cause health problems like urinary tract infections, pneumonia, sepsis and serious kidney problems like hemolytic uremic syndrome.\nPeople typically get E. coli by consuming food or water that is contaminated with infected animal feces or through contact with feces from a person who’s infected.\nRelated article\nE. coli outbreak linked to organic carrots leaves 1 dead and dozens sickened across the US\nResearch has showed that about half of organic food outbreaks are linked to produce and that may be due to farming methods.\nIn order for agricultural products like fruits and vegetables to be certified organic by the US Department of Agriculture, farmers and growers need to avoid using prohibited substances, such as synthetic ingredients, when managing pests, weeds, disease and soil.\n“In general, organic farms have less oversight than large, traditional-type farms,” said Dr. Nicole Iovine, an infectious disease specialist and chief hospital epidemiologist at the University of Florida Health. “Organic farms are more likely to use compost or manure rather than commercially bought fertilizers. If the compost is not properly processed such that pathogens naturally present in animal stool survive, the soil will become contaminated.”\nRelated article\nHow disease detectives’ quick work traced deadly E. coli outbreak to McDonald’s Quarter Pounders\nPratt remembers buying Bunny-Luv carrots, her go-to snack, on September 30.\nAround October 10, she says, she started having stomach problems, including light diarrhea with bloody mucus.\n“Every day, it just progressed worse, and it just wouldn’t stop,” Pratt said. “It went from having diarrhea from a few times a day, which was manageable, even stomach flu manageable, to upwards to about 10 to 15 times in one day.”\nThe tricky part, Iovine says, is that most of the symptoms associated with E. coli infection – such as vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps – are also common with other foodborne illnesses, so it can be difficult to tell if you have an E. coli infection.\nSymptoms usually start around three to four days after consuming the bacteria. Young children and older adults are more vulnerable to severe infections.\n“Most infections resolve on their own,” said Dr. Leana Wen, an emergency physician and clinical associate professor at George Washington University. She previously was Baltimore’s health commissioner, with responsibilities that included overseeing food safety. “Patients need supportive treatment with hydration but do not need specific therapy. Some benefit from antibiotics. Then there are some infections, notably O157:H7, where antibiotics are not used and in fact could worsen illness.”\nRelated video\nHow 4 simple words could protect you from food poisoning\nPeople who have severe stomach cramps or bloody diarrhea or who are unable to keep down fluids should seek medical attention, Wen said.\nPratt’s symptoms became too much to manage at home on October 21.\n“I couldn’t handle it anymore,” she said. “I couldn’t handle taking care of it at home anymore and watching my kids and my husband watch me. So I went to the hospital.”\nPratt was in the hospital for three days. She says she received nausea medications and pain medications.\n“I didn’t stay still the entire time I was there because I was so uncomfortable with pain,” she said. “It was just an awful experience.”\nIovine says the best way to avoid E. coli infections is to stick with the CDC’s recommendations: Wash your hands frequently, follow safe food preparation guidelines, and wash fruits and vegetables before eating them, even if the package says they are already washed.\nRelated article\nIllnesses from bacteria in food are on the rise. A doctor explains how to avoid them\n“Don’t ever trust that [label]. Always wash your vegetables,” she said. “It’s the last opportunity to remove any harmful bacteria that may be present. I’m really aware of things that grow in the dirt. I will rinse them, and then I remove whatever the outer layer is. If it’s an onion, I remove that outer layer. If it’s carrots, I always peel them, because you can’t get all the dirt off.”\nWhen Pratt saw the news report about the outbreak, she dropped everything and began cleaning out her fridge.\n“I went ahead and dumped all of my other food that I actually had in the bin with them,” she said. “I just dumped it. Brand new and all. I just didn’t want to take that chance. I literally bleached and soaked everything that they touched.”\nThe CDC also encourages drinking only water from safe sources. When you’re hiking, camping or traveling, make sure water is purified before consuming it. Avoid swallowing water when swimming or playing in outdoor water sources like lakes, ponds or pools.\nNearly a month after she was hospitalized, Pratt says she still feels “completely sluggish.”\n“I have not gotten my energy fully back since,” she said.\nPratt’s attorney, Ron Simon, and his law firm, Ron Simon & Associates, have established a Grimmway Farms E. Coli Claim Center to represent people who may have been sickened in the outbreak.\nPratt said that one of the worst feelings was the loss of trust in her food’s safety.\n“You buy the food; you bring it home; you trust it,” she said. “I’m just glad it was me, because I have two kids that absolutely love carrots, raw carrots, just like I do.”\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

    "content": "Essex Police has defended its actions after Daily Telegraph columnist Allison Pearson said she was left “dumbstruck” by a visit to her home on Remembrance Sunday over a social media post.\nOfficers visited Pearson as part of an investigation into alleged incitement to racial hatred, following a complaint from a member of the public, the force said.\nIn an article, Pearson said she was told by the police who came to her home it was over a “non-crime hate incident”, but not told which post it was about.\nThe force said “at no stage” did its officers tell her the investigation was related to a “non-crime hate incident\".\nA non-crime hate incident is where no criminal offence has been committed but the person reporting it believes the incident to be motivated by hostility.\nIn a statement, Essex Police said officers “went to a residential address to arrange a time to do an interview with a woman about a complaint made by a member of the public”.\n“At no stage during the short interaction between the woman and our officers was she informed that the report being investigated was being treated as a non-crime hate incident. To suggest otherwise is wholly inaccurate and misleading.\n“As the public would expect, we have body worn video of this interaction which entirely supports our position in this respect.”\nEssex Police later released what it said were transcribed lines spoken by an officer in the body worn video, which the BBC has not seen. It says the officer stated that the complaint had \"gone down as an incident or offence of potentially inciting racial hatred online\".\n\"Because of what’s been alleged and the evidence that we’ve got, I need to just ask you some questions,\" the officer also says.\nIn her article, Pearson said that when police visited her, she did not know what post on X that the complaint was about, but that \"a year ago, I was consumed with the aftermath of the Oct 7 attacks by Hamas\" and slogans brandished at pro-Palestinian marches.\nThe BBC has seen the now-deleted post that the police complaint relates to, which dates from 16 November last year. It shows an image of two police officers standing next to two men holding what appears to be a flag of the Pakistani political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).\nThe post tags the Metropolitan Police alongside the words “how dare they”.\nIt adds: “Invited to pose for a photo with lovely peaceful British Friends of Israel on Saturday police refused. Look at this lot smiling with the Jew haters.”\nX added a notice to the post stating that the image was taken in Manchester, not London, and that it is “not related to Palestine”.\nPearson said that when police turned up at her house last Sunday morning, she was shocked.\n\"I was definitely shocked. Astonished. That too. Upset. How could I not be?” she said, adding that she felt “a surge of instinctive anger. A non-crime - what the hell?”\nThe force has since lodged a complaint with the Independent Press Standards Organisation (Ipso) regulator over the Telegraph's reporting of the incident.\nThe BBC has been told by the Met Police that the original complaint was made by a member of the public on 18 November last year.\nThe force said it was contacted on social media by a member of the public “who wished to make an allegation that a post on X was a possible hate crime”.\nIt added that the allegation was recorded but not investigated, and then passed on to Sussex Police on 22 November last year, as the complainant lived in that county. Sussex Police then passed it to Essex Police, where she now lives.\nA number of political figures have come out in support of Pearson, including shadow home secretary Chris Philp and former prime minister Boris Johnson - and a debate has been sparked around free speech.\nMP Richard Tice, deputy leader of the Reform UK party, told the BBC the Telegraph columnist had been left \"terrified and scared\" by the police visit.\nHe also called on the chief constable of Essex Police to apologise to Pearson or risk bringing the force into disrepute.\nThe Home Office has already been looking into how forces review non-crime hate incidents in balance with the right to free speech.\nA spokesman for the prime minister's office said: “Ultimately it's important that the police can capture data relating to non-crime hate incidents... to help prevent serious crimes which may later occur.\n“This must be balanced with the fundamental right to free speech and also ensuring that the police can spend their time dealing with the issues that matter most to our communities.\"\nThe BBC has contacted The Daily Telegraph for comment.\nEssex Police said it supports free speech but \"it does not support inaccuracy\".\n\"If an alleged crime is reported, it is investigated. There is no public interest in falsehood.\"\nCopyright 2024 BBC. All rights reserved.  The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites. Read about our approach to external linking.\n"

    "content": "Senior doctors working at a Glasgow hospital have asked for a 'major incident' to be called this week but had their request declined, BBC Scotland News understands.\nEmergency medicine consultants described conditions in the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital (QEUH) as \"grossly\" unsafe with no room to take in new patients on Monday evening.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said it has a \"robust system\" in place to deal with additional pressures which were implemented.\nLast week, NHS Grampian declared a 'critical incident' because Aberdeen Royal Infirmary was full.\nA critical incident sees a level of disruption to services at a local level that may put patients and staff at risk of harm.\nIn comparison, a major incident has a range of serious consequences that present serious threat to the  health  of the community, where an emergency responder's ability to respond  is constrained.\nDocuments seen by BBC Scotland News describe the whole hospital site at the QEUH in Glasgow as being \"completely overwhelmed\" on Monday evening.\nThe emergency medicine consultants said a lack of capacity in accident and emergency left one patient waiting almost six hours in the back of an ambulance with a fractured hip.\nAt the same time five ambulances were on route and a further 19 expected to attend the hospital.\nThe document states that NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde chief executive Jane Grant was involved in discussions about whether a major incident should be called, but it is believed she declined the request.\nThe health board say the situation was resolved without involving the chief executive.\nNHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said all of its services are under \"considerable pressure\" with the arrival of winter bringing additional challenges.\nIn a statement, the hospital's board said: \"The A&E department at the QEUH has experienced particular pressures in recent days, and we would like to apologise to anyone who had to wait longer than they would have expected.\n\"NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has in place a robust system of escalation policies to help mitigate additional pressures, and these were implemented yesterday.\n\"The possibility of declaring a major incident was raised during a discussion around pressures on the department and hospital capacity, but given the mitigations that had been put in place that discussion was taken no further.\"\nA health-related major incident is described as any occurrence presenting a serious threat to the health of the community.\nIt is defined in the Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Principles (JESIP) as: “An event or situation with a range of serious consequences that require special arrangements to be implemented by one or more emergency responder.”\nIt is likely to involve disruption of services and require the implementation of special arrangements by multiple agencies such as hospitals, ambulance, and primary care trusts.\nAll hospitals are required to have plans in place in the event of a major incident being declared. This might include measures such as non-urgent procedures being cancelled or ambulances being diverted.\nHealth boards can also declare business continuity incidents and critical incidents.\nLast week, NHS Grampian said it had taken the \"significant step\" of declaring a critical board incident due to sustained and continuing demands on Aberdeen Royal Infirmary (ARI).\nPatients requiring immediate life-saving care were still dealt with at ARI but other patients were diverted hospitals in Dundee and Elgin when it is deemed \"clinically appropriate\" to do so.\nSome elective procedures and appointments were also postponed.\nHealth Secretary Neil Gray said \"patient safety is paramount\" following the critical incident.\nHe added: “This type of sustained pressure that services are facing is not unique to Scotland, similar challenges are being felt across the UK.\n“While Scotland continues to have the best performing core A&E departments in the UK, performance is not of the standard we all expect.\"\nHospitals in Scotland have been facing growing pressures in recent years.\nA review by Audit Scotland said fundamental change in how NHS services are provided in Scotland is \"urgently needed\" to cope with growing demand.\nA 38-year-old man was seriously hurt in the attack at Auldhouse Park in Glasgow on Friday evening.\nNahla Abdulla was feeling lost and lonely in a new country until learning to cycle pushed her to turn her life around.\nThe How Are You Really Feeling? campaign runs until 12 January.\nThe trust is one of the biggest in England and runs five different hospitals.\nUsers of the service say they could not have quit smoking without the support of the programme.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Thousands of people have descended on the site where former Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed by an Israeli air strike, after the group allowed access to the area for the first time for a public memorial.\nThe massive crater left by the Beirut strike was lit up in red and festooned with Hezbollah flags. At its centre, torches projected light beams into the night sky.\nMen, women and children wept at the sight of the crater, while the crowd chanted “At your service, Nasrallah” – a common rallying cry among Hezbollah supporters.\nNasrallah led Hezbollah for more than 30 years as it became a formidable force in Lebanon, turning him into one of the most influential figures in the Middle East.\nA ceasefire deal agreed between Hezbollah and Israel on Wednesday paved the way for the southern suburb where Nasrallah was killed, on 27 September, to be opened to journalists and the public.\nThe militant and political group had previously closely guarded access to the suburb, known as the Dahieh, particularly the place where Nasrallah was assassinated, which was entirely closed off.\nThe Israeli strike that killed the Hezbollah leader was reportedly made up of as many as 80 bunker busting bombs, and it destroyed several residential buildings in Harek Hreik – the neighbourhood that forms the centre of Hezbollah’s operations in Beirut.\nWhen the crowd was granted access to the site for the first time on Saturday night, people surged into the open area left by the destroyed buildings and climbed up around the edges of the crater.\nMany held aloft candles and pictures of Nasrallah, who was 64, while a speech by the former leader played from a sound system.\n“For these two and half months we have refused to believe that he is really gone,” said Narjis Khshaish, 31, who wept and clutched a candle.\n“We have all just been waiting to reach this place to receive his blessings,” she said.\nMoussa Dirani, 57, brought his teenage son to the memorial event. “It is very sad and painful to see this site,” he said. “But the resistance does not stop with Nasrallah, his death gives us power to continue along his path.”\nThe hundreds of Hezbollah flags at the event would “continue to fly high”, said Fida Nasreddine, 34. “We are with Hassan Nasrallah until the last breath,” she said.\nNasrallah’s assassination shocked Lebanon and the wider world when the news broke in September. He had rarely been seen in public since Hezbollah’s 2006 war with Israel, and was protected by tight security at all times.\nHe was one of a number of senior Hezbollah figures killed by Israel in air strikes between September and the ceasefire agreement struck on Wednesday.\nThe group had been badly damaged by the assassinations, but the sense of celebration in the Hezbollah-dominated areas of Beirut \"cannot be dismissed as insincere\", said David Wood, a Lebanon analyst with Crisis Group.\n\"The achievements that Hezbollah has promoted - maintaining its ground operations against Israel, ensuring that tens of thousands of Israelis couldn't return to their homes, and having a severe impact on Israel's economy, I don't think those achievements are nothing, and I think lots of its supporters will see an element of victory in that.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Joanna Mazjoub.\n\n\nIsrael seized control of a buffer zone between the Golan Heights and Syria after the fall of Bashar al-Assad.\nThe Israeli military says it targeted two groups of Hamas members who planned to hijack the lorries.\nThe bus was heading to Jerusalem from an Israeli settlement when a gunman opened fire.\nAbu Mohammed al-Jolani also said he would dissolve the former regime's  security forces, in a statement seen by Reuters.\nIsrael has attacked Syrian military assets and has troops operating in the Golan buffer zone and slightly beyond.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Pidcock won mountain biking gold at the Olympics in Tokyo and Paris\nGreat Britain's Tom Pidcock is to leave the Ineos Grenadiers team at the end of the season.\nThe 25-year-old has been with the team since 2021 and will depart despite having signed a new five-year contract in 2022.\nPidcock retained his Olympic mountain bike title when he won gold at the Games in Paris this year.\nFor Ineos, he won a stage of the Tour de France in 2022, while also claiming victory in the prestigious Strade Bianche and Amstel Gold Race one-day classics.\nHowever, he failed to win a stage at this year's Tour de France and there was speculation over the rider's relationship with the team's management.\nIn October, Pidcock said he had been \"deselected\" for the Giro di Lombardia \"just as things were on the up after a turbulent end to the year\".\n\"So many amazing memories that will stick with me for a lifetime,\" said Pidcock following the announcement of his exit.\n\"I can't thank enough all the hard-working people in the team who brought so much and helped me achieve my dreams - thank you Ineos Grenadiers.\n\"Going to miss you boys. When one door closes another opens.\"\nIneos Grenadiers chief executive John Allert said: \"Weâre really proud of the work we've done with Tom to help him achieve some extraordinary and memorable moments.\n\"Together we've written a powerful chapter and shown how exciting and diverse professional cycling can be.\n\"Tom has some big multi-disciplinary goals and we believe this decision enables both of us to pursue our future ambitions with clarity, purpose and determination.\n\"We thank Tom for the last four years and wish him the best of luck for the future.\"\nMatt Warwick, BBC Sport\nHe was the next big British hero, for the big British team. And he was on a big contract.\nPidcock is a rider unlike previous Sky-era home heroes, such as Tour winners Bradley Wiggins, Chris Froome and Geraint Thomas - in physiology and character.\nHe is a self-confessed daredevil, who takes as much pleasure in throwing himself out of a moving speedboat as he does descending a mountain at 90km/h in the Tour.\nAnd Ineos were perfectly happy for him to live that life, even if in recent times Thomas himself said of Pidcock's inter-team presence: \"The people around Tom donât help.\"\nBut what was harder to pin down was what kind of rider Pidcock was to a high-budget team expected to win the Tour de France for the first time since 2019.\nMany hoped he would go on to challenge for the overall yellow jersey after his astonishing stage 12 victory on Alpe d'Huez in 2022, but it was becoming gradually acknowledged that he is more of a one-day specialist on a road or mountain bike.\nPidcock will go on to win big races on a big contract elsewhere. But he, like every other rider in the modern era, operates in the shadow of the mighty Tadej Pogacar, the reigning Tour champion.\nAnd it is the next Pogacar that Ineos need in order to rediscover their status in a sport which is leaving them behind.\n'A long journey' - Evenepoel has surgery after crash\nComments can not be loaded\nTo load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser\nPremier League: Build-up to five games  with Arsenal and Liverpool both in action\nThree matches in Scottish Premiership - radio & text\nChampions Cup: Bulls 21-25 Northampton - Saints clinging on for famous win\nAn epic story of life, love and loss\nA star-studded adaptation of Leo Tolstoy's timeless novel set in nineteenth-century Russia\nThe long history of UFOs in the United States\nDon explores the origins of the 'flying saucer' and the end of the stigma against researching UFOs\nStrike and Robin tackle their latest thrilling case\nTom Burke and Holliday Grainger star in another masterful Robert Galbraith mystery\nThe hidden scandal of Power of Attorney\nHow one man controls the finances of vulnerable people\nUsyk v Fury 2 - all you need to know\n'The award goes to...' - England Test team's year in gongs\nVoyce - a wing who took flight with Wasps\nThe best pictures from the 2024 F1 season\n'I want Maddy's death to lead to more support for girls playing football'\nSonic & Knuckles make me fear for my Bills in 'Super Bowl rehearsal'\nTeam-mates' wardrobes & swapping lives with Musk - Man City Honesty Cards.

We didn't play well enough,\" he said.\n\"It's still 1-1 and plenty of things left [to come] in this series and definitely a way for us to get back into it.

    "content": "On the morning of 13 November, four weeks into the murder trial of 10-year-old Sara Sharif, came a moment so dramatic it left jurors open-mouthed and an Old Bailey courtroom horrified.\nSara’s father Urfan Sharif had not long been in the witness box on the seventh day of giving evidence when suddenly, trembling, he uttered five words that would change the course of the trial.\n“She died because of me.”\nUntil then, he had denied almost everything, instead blaming his wife - Sara’s stepmother - for her death. Now he was suddenly taking full responsibility for his daughter's death.\nIt was the defining moment of an eight-week murder trial, which was disturbing and heart-breaking for jurors to sit through. They listened to horrifying details of Sara’s short, desperate life - the torture, the beatings, the injuries - and watched the courtroom drama of a husband and wife turning on each other.\nWarning: This article contains descriptions of physical abuse\nThe trial began just over a year after Sara was found dead in a bunkbed in her home - alone and abandoned by her family.\nInside the glass-panelled dock at London's Old Bailey were the three people accused of her murder; Sara’s father, Urfan Sharif, her stepmother, Beinash Batool, and her uncle, Faisal Malik. They were separated by dock officers but were, I imagined, still too close for comfort.\n\"There is a head-on conflict brewing between the defendants,” prosecutor Bill Emlyn Jones KC said at the start of the trial.\nSharif was smartly dressed in a white collared shirt and black jacket. He was much thinner than in the pictures we had seen of him. Batool had gold-rimmed glasses on and wore a mustard jacket, with her hair tied back.\nIn the weeks they spent together in the dock not once did I see the two of them make eye contact. Most of the time they stared ahead. Sometimes they would look down at bundles of evidence.\nOn days Batool arrived first, her husband would have to walk within inches of her to get to his seat. They never turned to each other and they never spoke.\nBoth would often cry. The sounds of her sobbing would fill the courtroom. One day proceedings had to be suspended when Sharif, upset, walked out of the dock.\nHe would go on to brand his wife a “psycho” from the witness box, only to later take it back. One day she called out “liar” while he was giving evidence.\nThe first days of the trial were particularly shocking. Sara’s treatment had been brutal, the prosecutor said.\nX-rays were put up on screens showing her fractured bones. Computer-generated images showed the extensive bruising over her body. “I’m afraid you may find even the graphical depictions upsetting,\" the prosecutor told the jury.\nMr Emlyn Jones KC took us through the dozens of horrific injuries, both old and new - fractures and refractures, puncture wounds and abrasions, burns, blisters and bite marks.\n\nMore on this story\nThere was an injury to Sara’s abdomen and a traumatic injury to her brain.\nJust when we thought it could not get any worse there was more disturbing and sadistic evidence, that Sara had been hooded and repeatedly tied up or restrained. You could feel the lingering sense of horror in the courtroom.\nIn court, the prosecutor took us inside the house in Woking, Surrey, where Sara lived and where she was ultimately murdered.\nWe watched haunting footage from an officer’s body-worn camera of the moment police arrived to discover her body. The police officer who found Sara recalled how he had “pulled back the cover and underneath there was the body of a 10-year-old girl”.\nSome witnesses gave evidence from behind a screen, shielded from the defendants and the public. One of them was Sara’s primary school teacher. It was Helen Simmons who first brought Sara's personality to life during the trial.\nShe described her former pupil as “often bubbly” and a girl who “at times could be sassy”. She said her “happy space” was on stage singing and performing.\nThere were other deeply poignant moments during the trial.\nIn one video we saw Sara dancing at home two days before she died. Batool cried when it was played. In another we got to hear Sara’s voice, as she played in the garden with other children one sunny day two months before she died.\nJust over three weeks into the trial Sharif’s barrister Naeem Mian KC was on his feet.\n“What’s going to happen now,\" he said, \"is Mr Sharif is going to take what amounts to the longest walk of his life from that dock to the witness box.” The courtroom fell silent.\nSara’s father, slightly built and dressed in a white fleece top and jeans, appeared at the dock door and took the three steps down into the courtroom.\nAs he stepped up into the witness box he was already upset, pulling tissues from a box in front of him. Once he sat down his barrister slowly and carefully led him through his version of events. He spoke quietly and mumbled at times.\nFor the next six days Sharif maintained his daughter’s death had had nothing to do with him. He admitted slapping Sara, but denied beating her. He placed the blame firmly on his wife saying he had never been there when abuse happened. It turned out he was an exceptional liar.\nDuring his evidence he was highly emotional and cried many times, often struggling to get his words out. “My Sara,” he would say over and over. Through tears he spoke of his “beautiful angel” whose favourite food was chicken biriyani and favourite colour was pink.\n“Were you close to her?\" asked his barrister. “Yes,” Sharif replied.\nWhen his daughter died in his arms he said he had felt “numb”. “I was crushed. The whole world fallen on me.”\nAs he tried to convince the jury, he sounded rehearsed.\nOn the second day of Sharif’s evidence there was a dramatic moment. Voice raised and emotional, Sharif pointed towards his wife in the dock and called her a “psycho” and “evil”.\nBut it was under forensic cross-examination by his wife’s barrister that Sharif finally cracked.\nCaroline Carberry KC dredged up his past, the previous partners he had allegedly threatened to kill and the arrests for false imprisonment for which he had never been charged.\n“You are a lying, manipulative, controlling man,” Ms Carberry KC went on to say.\nShe got him to stand for her questions and took him to task when he pointed towards her client in the dock again.\nIt was the seventh day of his evidence when everything changed.\nSharif was being questioned about missing the birth of one of his children. He started trying to interrupt her, while she persisted in trying to get him to answer the questions.\nEventually he managed to get it out. “I want to say something.”\n“I admit what I said in my phone call and my written note, every single word.”\nThere was a pause as everyone took in what he had just said.\nThen Ms Carberry KC ran with it, grabbing a copy of the note that he had left by his daughter’s body. She started to go through it line by line.\n“Did you kill your daughter by beating?\" “Yes,” he replied. “She died because of me.”\n“It was you who inflicted those injuries on her wasn’t it?” “Yes,” he said.\n“Do you accept causing the fractures?” “Yes ma’am.” “Did you use the cricket bat?” “Yes ma’am.” “Did you use the white metal pole?” “Yes ma’am.”\nSurprise turned to shock and shock turned to horror, as he agreed to more and more cruel acts. Some jurors sat open-mouthed.\n“I take full responsibility for everything,” he said.\nHe was shaking and crying. Batool was sobbing in the dock.\nEven Sharif’s barrister was taken by complete surprise. “I had absolutely no idea he was going to do that. You can imagine my reaction when it did happen?” he would later tell the jury.\nEventually Batool ran out of court sobbing and the hearing was suspended. Some jurors were later seen in tears.\nSharif continued to deny causing the burn and bite marks on Sara.\nMs Carberry KC asked Sharif if he wanted to have the charge of murder put to him again.\n“Yes ma’am,” he said, before his barrister intervened and asked to speak to him.\nWhen the court reconvened Sharif said he did not accept he was guilty of murder. “I didn’t intend to kill her,” he said.\nSharif spent nine days in the witness box. We will never know what made him crack in the end. The pressure of having to keep up with his extensive lies? Or the realisation that there was no way out?\nThe jury never got to hear from Sara's stepmother. Batool declined to give evidence. So we never heard her explain why she refused to provide dental impressions for comparisons to the bite marks found on Sara. Sharif and Malik had both been ruled out as a match.\nWe will also never know who caused the iron burn to Sara's bottom. Sharif insisted it was not him.\nOne day the prosecutor suggested it would have taken two people to hold Sara down and burn her. \"Who was it?\" he asked.\n\"I don't know Sir, must have been kids?\" Sharif replied. \"How low will you stoop?\" replied the prosecutor.\nWhat we do know is that Batool knew for at least two years that her husband was beating Sara.\nAfter deliberating for nine hours and 46 minutes, the jury decided Sharif was not alone in murdering the ten-year-old. Batool had either assaulted Sara, or encouraged or assisted Sharif in carrying out at least some of the brutal attacks. And those had either caused or contributed significantly to her death.\nIn the end, Batool was the primary child carer in the house.\nFaisal Malik, Sara's uncle, also declined to give evidence in the trial.\nThe jury will have been sure that he must have known what was going on in the house and did not take reasonable steps to prevent or stop the violence that led to Sara's death.\nAs the court assembled to hear the verdicts the judge asked for silence and respect.\nBoth Sharif and Batool were found guilty of murder. Malik, cleared of Sara's murder, was found guilty of causing or allowing her death. Sharif looked straight ahead, while Batool sobbed and Malik cried, as the verdicts were delivered.\nThe three of them were led out of the dock and down to the cells, bringing an end to the trial.\nThe horror that had been felt for weeks in the courtroom quietly turned into a deep sadness for Sara - the confident, chatty and caring 10-year-old girl who had big dreams of becoming a ballet dancer.\nAdditional reporting by Daniel Sandford.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

I'm reading it and it's just weird because it's outside my front door.\"\nThe Reardon family moved into the property about two months ago, after selling their family home.\nLiam recalled driving over the area where the hole later appeared during the Saturday morning.\n\"We got a call at 2 o'clock in the afternoon saying we had a small sinkhole at the end of our drive. From there, it progressively got worse and worse throughout the evening,\" he said.\n\"We were in the house Sunday morning, having breakfast. The neighbours were out on the street, we had highway maintenance and engineers and stuff, all in our street.\n\"Then all of a sudden, our front gates and our front wall just disappeared into the hole. Our driveway started eating away.\n\"So then everyone's on the street [shouting] 'get out of the house, get out of the house'. I'm having a cup of tea now, a cup of coffee, my yoghurt, my eggs, and the driveway's just falling away.\n\"We could hear the thumping of the ground just disappearing. It was like we were in a movie.\"\nHe said they had to \"pack a case quickly and evacuate the house\" and have been unable to return.\n\"Luckily, none of us are injured… but it's a big inconvenience,\" he said.\n\"It's the run-up to Christmas, we are virtually homeless.\n\"Our dogs Dolly and Otis, they don't know what's happening, they don't know if they're coming or going.\n\"We've been there a couple of months and they've kind of got used to that place and now we've had to move out and we're in this random AirBnB and the dogs don't know where they are again.\n\"Reality is, we're out of our home, we don't have a home now to live in.\"\nMegan Barton-Hanson wants more people to know removing a condom during sex can be classified as rape.\nBusinesses say a sinkhole which has not been repaired in two months is affecting trade.\nWork has begun to fill a sinkhole which forced 30 homes to be evacuated.\nResidents from seven houses are allowed back to their houses after a sinkhole opened on their street.\nSome people are in hotels or with relatives and one couple said it was horrendous before Christmas.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "A child developed a life-threatening infection after being repeatedly drugged by her mother, a judge has found.\nThe unprescribed medication was administered for more than a year and led to the girl needing a long stay at a children’s hospital, unable to eat or drink and needing 10 blood transfusions.\nThe judge found her mother’s actions caused the girl, now aged 15, to also suffer significant emotional and psychological harm.\nTwo other women accused of harming their children in the same way at the same hospital around the same time were found to have not done so following a Family Court hearing.\nThe children were all long stay patients – often on the same ward – at Sheffield Children’s Hospital during 2020 and 2021.\nEach came from separate, previously unconnected families but developed unexplained medical problems that led to their mothers being arrested.\nThe women, who had all stayed with their children at the hospital, were accused of making their children ill by administering unprescribed drugs and by deliberately contaminating their feeding lines with faecal material.\nAll the children made a rapid recovery after their mothers were arrested.\nReporting restrictions prevent the naming of any of the families involved in the case.\nAll three children - the girl and two young boys, now aged five and six, presented with chronic digestive – gastroenterological – illnesses and an apparent inability to eat and drink normally.\nEach had to have lines inserted into a vein to deliver nutrients to keep them alive.\nThey had an exceptionally high number of bacterial infections in their lines, leading to life-threatening sepsis.\nClinicians at Sheffield Children's Hospital could not understand why the children were so ill and eventually concluded they might be the victim of fabricated or induced illness (FII).\nThis is described by the NHS as “a rare form of child abuse”, where a parent exaggerates or deliberately causes symptoms of illness in a child.\nThe actions of each mother were suggested to have led to multiple, avoidable medical interventions, prolonged hospitalisation and brought each child close to death.\nThe mothers of the two boys were found not to have done so.\nThe girl’s mother, who has two other children, was arrested in February 2021 after a urine test on her daughter showed the presence of ibuprofen, an anti-inflammatory drug, which had not been prescribed.\nA police search found 96 ibuprofen tablets, laxatives, a feeding syringe and a pill crusher.\nA Family Court hearing in Leeds in 2023, the judgment from which has only now been published, concluded that from September 2019 to February 2021, the woman, known as MR, administered unprescribed medication to her daughter.\nShe was given both ibuprofen and piroxicam, a strong pain killer.  While the girl was aware her mother was giving her the drugs, she did not know what they were.\nJudge Mr Justice Poole concluded taking the drugs had led to the teenager suffering abdominal pain and inflammation, nausea and vomiting, stomach ulcers and gastro-intestinal bleeding.\nMR also gave her daughter the laxative Bisacodyl, which the judge said led to her suffering recurrent diarrhoea.\nThe drugs caused the girl to undergo unnecessary medical interventions, including 10 blood transfusions and surgery to stop ulcers bleeding.\nShe also had to have a gastric tube fitted, lines inserted to allow nutrition, and multiple endoscopies, in which a camera is inserted into the body to investigate a condition.\nAn investigation into the mother showed that she had required periods of hospital treatment herself for symptoms that were never fully medically explained, including “pseudo-seizures,” the authenticity of which was questioned by both clinicians and her own family.\nAt the time of her arrest, she was on repeat prescriptions of a strong painkiller for chronic back pain.  She also had mental health issues.\nThe judge concluded that the relationship between mother and daughter at the hospital became “very intense and unhealthy,” exacerbated by Covid restrictions.\n“The isolation and mutual dependency…provided a culture within which unusual and harmful behaviours could develop,” the judge wrote.\nEven after her mother’s arrest, the girl continued to take ibuprofen “in an attempt to make herself ill, to cover up for her mother,” he added.\nIn April 2021, the girl was discharged from hospital into the care of her father and grandparents.  She is able to eat normally and has not had any further infections.\nShe attends school but continues to complain of abdominal pain and remains under the care of a paediatrician.\nThe Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) and South Yorkshire Police have been approached for comment.\nThe other two mothers were arrested in October 2021. Searches of the rooms they used or had access to did not find evidence to suggest they had been harming their children.\nThere was also no evidence, the judge said, that any of the three women had tampered with their children’s feeding lines.\nHe added that national guidelines for clinicians had not been followed as it should have been. This meant when the mothers were referred to social services and the police, the NHS trust had not gathered the evidence it could have done.\nAt that point, the “accepted narrative” at the Trust was that each mother was guilty of FII (fabricated or induced illness), he said.\nDr Jeff Perring, executive medical director at Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust, said: “This was a finding of fact hearing in the Family Court and, as the judgment makes clear, it was not an inquiry into the conduct of the Trust and its clinicians.\n“The 2021 Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health guidance referred to in the judgement is fully embedded at the Trust. Our policies and procedures are reviewed to factor in learning and ensure they continue to be robust and reflect best practice.”\nThe South Yorkshire firearms officer gets a written warning after falling asleep while deployed.\nThe charity says it wants to create a \"welcoming environment\" in Sheffield.\nThe man made multiple attempts to frighten his ex-partner with threatening calls, police say.\nNina Wilson said she wants Maddy Cusack's death to lead to more support for young players.\nInquest questions why bus driver's killer was allowed leave from secure mental health unit.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "A New Zealand naval ship which crashed into a coral reef before it caught fire and sank had been left on autopilot, an official inquiry has found.\nCrew members of HMNZS Manawanui had thought the ship was under manual control while sailing in Samoan waters.\nAll 75 people aboard were evacuated safely. But the submerged ship started leaking oil into the ocean, prompting fears in nearby coastal villages.\nHMNZS Manawanui was the first ship New Zealand had lost since World War Two. It was one of nine ships in the country's small navy fleet.\nThe first report from an inquiry into the incident was released on Friday. It found that crew members had believed there were problems with the ship's thruster when they could not change the vessel's direction.\nBut none of the crew had checked whether the ship was still on autopilot, before it crashed.\nNavy chief Garin Golding told reporters that “the direct cause of the grounding has been determined as a series of human errors\".\n\"Muscle memory from the person in control should have leaned over to that panel and checked whether the screen said autopilot or not.\"\nThe inquiry is expected to finish next year. Golding said that following the inquiry's completion, officials would start a separate disciplinary process involving three unnamed crew members.\n\"I want to reassure the public of New Zealand that we will learn from this situation and that it is on me, as the Chief of Navy, to earn back your trust,\" he said.\nHe added that divers were monitoring the “persistent slow leak”.\nWhile equipment is set to be transported to Samoa this week to remove fuel and other pollutants from the ship, New Zealand authorities have not announced plans to remove the ship.\nThe ship was conducting a survey of waters off the island of Upolu when it struck a reef and caught fire during a bout of rough and windy weather. It sank shortly after that.\nIn the following days, social media users started trolling the ship’s female captain, claiming that her gender was to blame.\nThese commenters were denounced at the time by New Zealand’s defence minister as “armchair admirals”.\nEngland's seamers leave New Zealand 315-9 after the opening day of the third and final Test in Hamilton.\nEngland are no longer in contention but which sides can still qualify for the World Test Championship - and what do they need to make it?\nSeamer Matthew Potts replaces Chris Woakes in the only change to the England XI for the third and final Test against New Zealand in Hamilton.\nThe industry has long faced criticism, with some breeders accused of mistreating or doping the animals.\nFixtures, results and scorecards from England's three-Test tour of New Zealand.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "In October, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sent a chartered flight carrying Indian nationals back home, marking a growing trend in deportations to India.\nThis was no ordinary flight - it was one of multiple large-scale “removal flights” carried out this year, each typically carrying more than 100 passengers. The flights were returning groups of Indian migrants who \"did not establish a legal basis to remain in the US\".\nAccording to US officials, the latest flight carrying adult men and women was routed to Punjab, close to many deportees' places of origin. No precise breakdown of hometowns was provided.\nIn the US fiscal year 2024 which ended in September, more than 1,000 Indian nationals had been repatriated by charter and commercial flights, according to Royce Bernstein Murray, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security.\n“That has been part of a steady increase in removals from the US of Indian nationals over the past few years, which corresponds with a general increase in encounters that we have seen with Indian nationals in the last few years as well,” Ms Murray told a media briefing. (Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country’s borders with Mexico or Canada.)\nAs the US ramps up repatriations of Indian nationals, concerns grow about how President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies will affect them. Trump has already promised the biggest deportation of migrants in history.\nSince October 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have detained nearly 170,000 Indian migrants attempting unauthorised crossings at both the northern and southern land borders.\n“Though smaller than the numbers from Latin America and the Caribbean, Indian nationals represent the largest group of migrants from outside the Western Hemisphere encountered by the CBP in the past four years,” say Gil Guerra and Sneha Puri, immigration analysts at Niskanen Center, a Washington-based think tank.\nAs of 2022, an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants were in the US, making them the third-largest group after those from Mexico and El Salvador, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. Unauthorised immigrants in all make up 3% of US’s total population and 22% of the foreign-born population.\nLooking at the data, Mr Guerra and Ms Puri have identified notable trends in the spike in Indians attempting illegal border crossings.\nFor one, the migrants are not from the lowest economic strata. But they cannot secure tourist or student visas to the US, often due to lower education or English proficiency.\nInstead, they rely on agencies charging up to $100,000 (£79,000), sometimes using long and arduous routes designed to dodge border controls. To afford this, many sell farms or take out loans. Not surprisingly, data from the US immigration courts in 2024 reveals that the majority of Indian migrants were male, aged 18-34.\nSecond, Canada on the northern border has become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with a visitor visa processing time of 76 days (compared to up to a year for a US visa in India).\nThe Swanton Sector - covering the states of Vermont and counties in New York and New Hampshire - has experienced a sudden surge in encounters with Indian nationals since early this year, peaking at 2,715 in June, the researchers found.\nEarlier, most irregular Indian migrants entered the Americas through the busier southern border with Mexico via El Salvador or Nicaragua, both of which facilitated migration. Until November last year, Indian nationals enjoyed visa-free travel to El Salvador.\n“The US-Canada border is also longer and less guarded than the US-Mexico border. And while it is not necessarily safer, criminal groups do not have the same presence there as they do along the route from South and Central America,” Mr Guerra and Ms Puri say.\nThirdly, much of the migration appears to originate from the Sikh-dominated Indian state of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana, which has traditionally seen people migrating overseas. The other source of origin is Gujarat, the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nPunjab, which accounts for a large share of irregular Indian migrants, is facing economic hardships, including high unemployment, farming distress and a looming drug crisis.\nMigration has also long been common among Punjabis, with rural youth still eager to move abroad.\nA recent study of 120 respondents in Punjab by Navjot Kaur, Gaganpreet Kaur and Lavjit Kaur found that 56% emigrated between ages 18-28, often after secondary education. Many funded their move through non-institutional loans, later sending remittances to their families.\nThen there has been a rise in tensions over the separatist Khalistan movement, which seeks to establish an independent homeland for Sikhs. “This has caused fear from some Sikhs in India about being unfairly targeted by authorities or politicians. These fears may also provide a credible basis for claims of persecution that allows them to seek asylum, whether or not true,” says Ms Puri.\nBut pinning down the exact triggers for migration is challenging.\n“While motivations vary, economic opportunity remains the primary driver, reinforced by social networks and a sense of pride in having family members 'settled' in the US,” says Ms Puri.\nFourth, researchers found a shift in the family demographics of Indian nationals at the borders.\nMore families are trying to cross the border. In 2021, single adults were overwhelmingly detained at both borders. Now, family units make up 16-18% of the detentions at both borders.\nThis has sometimes led to tragic consequences. In January 2022, an Indian family of four - part of a group of 11 people from Gujarat - froze to death just 12m (39ft) from the border in Canada while attempting to enter the US.\nPablo Bose, a migration and urban studies scholar at the University of Vermont, says Indians are trying to cross into the US in larger numbers because of more economic opportunities and “more ability to enter the informal economies in the US cities”, especially the large ones like New York or Boston.\n“From everything I know and interviews I have conducted, most of the Indians are not staying in the more rural locations like Vermont or upstate New York but rather heading to the cities as soon as they can,” Mr Bose told the BBC. There, he says, they are entering mostly informal jobs like domestic labour and restaurant work.\nThings are likely to become more difficult soon. Veteran immigration official Tom Homan, who will be in charge of the country's borders following Trump's inauguration in January, has said that the northern border with Canada is a priority because illegal migration in the area is a “huge national security issue”.\nWhat happens next is unclear. “It remains to be seen if Canada would impose similar policies to prevent people migrating into the US from its borders. If that happens, we can expect a decline in detentions of Indians nationals at the border,” says Ms Puri.\nWhatever the case, the dreams driving thousands of desperate Indians to seek a better life in the US are unlikely to fade, even as the road ahead becomes more perilous.\nThe former House speaker suffered an unspecified injury while on an official trip to Luxembourg, her office says.\nPersistent rain means only 13.2 overs are possible on the opening day of the third Test between Australia and India in Brisbane.\nIndia marks the centenary of Raj Kapoor, who would have turned 100 on Saturday, with celebratory events.\nThe Grammy and Emmy winner sued the British TV producer a year ago. He described her claims as \"an appalling smear\".\nThe US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The Conservative government left the courts in financial limbo until June because it failed to settle their funding, the most senior judge in England and Wales has told MPs.\nBaroness Sue Carr, the lady chief justice, told Parliament's Justice Committee the criminal courts were in a \"drastic\" state and the previous government had repeatedly failed to offer funds in time for each new financial year.\nShe said the new Labour government’s decision to financially peg back how much work judges could do meant some courts would be out of use, despite record backlogs.\nShe predicted that those cuts would save no money and were \"distressing\" for victims and everyone else involved in the system.\nBaroness Carr’s comments on the state of the courts come as the system struggles with record backlogs of around 68,000 open cases in the Crown Courts.\nThose backlogs have been caused by a combination of complex factors, including the pandemic, but have their roots in a decision to cap justice spending before then.\nSpeaking to MPs on the cross-party committee, Baroness Carr said the outgoing Conservative government had repeatedly failed to offer funding in time and had not made an offer for the 2024-25 financial year, which began in April, until June.\n\"The offer wasn't made until June, and agreement was not reached until June,\" she said.\n\"The latest it has been agreed, I think, is possibly July, even August.\n\"In the last six years, so far as I'm aware, the concordat agreement has never been reached before the year itself starts.\"\nBaroness Carr said that while there were enough judges available to sit on cases for 113,000 days a year, the new government had pegged funding for them 6,500 days below that ceiling.\n\"The decision to limit us to 106,500 has, frankly, had a drastic effect across the board,\" she said.\n\"Judges have had to take fixed cases out of their lists. They've all had to cancel bookings [of part-time judges].\"\nBaroness Carr said the cases being removed from the schedule includes serious violence and sexual offences - and some of these could not be heard before 2027.\n\"The cases that are being taken out of the lists are cases that were ready to be heard before next April, so cases with judges, staff, courts, advocates, witnesses and complainants available,\" she said.\n\"Their removals are accompanied by long delays, sometimes years. This has been a most distressing time for witnesses, for police, CPS, advocates, court staff and judges alike.\"\nGiving three examples of cuts from south-west England, she told the MPs that Bristol Crown Court had removed \"hundreds\" of cases from its schedule because it was having to close 40% of its courtrooms a week due to a lack of funds.\nIn Taunton, there would only be 60 court days available between January and March 2025 to run trials that needed 265 days. Truro’s crown court would be shutting one day a week.\n\"This is not about saving anything,\" she said.\n\"It is not about saving money. You are deferring the cost - and indeed you are increasing it.\n\"You are increasing it because inflation will mean everything costs more.\n\"You are increasing it because barristers and the Crown Prosecution Service are going to have to redo the work they had done to be ready for trial, because the case will be stale.\n\"And that is not even to touch upon the acute social cost... particularly where  [sexual offences] complainants simply don't feel able to have confidence in the system anymore and walk away.\"\nA Ministry of Justice spokesperson said: \"The new government increased the number of Crown Court sitting days to a total of 106,500 – more than in six out of the last seven years.\n\"While we are bound by a challenging financial inheritance, this government is committed to bearing down on the Crown Court backlog.\n\"On top of increasing sitting days, we are extending magistrates’ court sentencing powers from six to 12 months, freeing up to 2,000 days in the Crown Courts to handle the most serious cases, and recruiting more judges.\"\nThe Conservative Party has been approached for comment.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "A man has been jailed for life with a minimum term of 14 years for murdering his college friend, who died more than six years after he was stabbed.\nJamel Boyce was left blind, paralysed and unable to speak after he was attacked on Clapham High Street in south London in 2016.\nTyrese Osei-Kofi was detained for 10 years in 2018 for wounding Mr Boyce with intent, but the Met Police launched a murder investigation after Mr Boyce died from his injuries in a care home in 2022 and in November Osei-Kofi pleaded guilty to murder.\nAt the Old Bailey on Friday Mr Boyce's father Patrick Boyce said in a statement that he hoped the defendant would find \"somewhere in his heart, some remorse\".\nThe court heard Osei-Kofi's attack on his 17-year-old friend on 14 October 2016 had followed a \"minor disagreement\" and during the attack Mr Boyce was seen being pinned up against a wall by Osei-Kofi.\nOsei-Kofi had then stabbed him in the chest and leg, shouted for a \"chiv\" and made remarks such as \"Do you want me to do it?\", and \"Do you know who I am?\".\nJamel suffered a cardiac arrest causing brain damage and a post-mortem examination found the cause of his death was a penetrating injury to the chest, the court was previously told.\nJamel's parents gave emotional addresses to the court on Friday, both of them detailing the \"agony\" of waiting eight years to hear Osei-Kofi admit he killed their son.\nLooking towards where the defendant was sat, Mr Boyce's father Patrick Boyce told the court in his statement: \"Having to wait all these years for the truth to be revealed, the agony, the pain, the doubts that pass through my mind cannot be explained.\n\"I hope in time he finds, somewhere in his heart, some remorse.\"\nIn a tearful victim impact statement read to the court, Mr Boyce's mother Pansy Boyce said: \"Jamel was a shy, humble boy who always used to have a smile on his face.\"\n\"What was meant to be an ordinary day… turned into a nightmare that we are forced to endure every single day,\" his mother continued.\n\"This will ripple through our lives for years to come.\"\nDefence barrister Graham Trembath KC noted the \"real sadness\" of the attack \"was that they were, it appears at times, good friends\".\nThe court heard that Osei-Kofi also wrote in a letter to the judge that he and Jamel were \"good friends\" and said Jamel had been to his house, his mother had cooked for him and they had spent a lot of time \"chilling together\".\nThe court heard Mr Boyce was known by the nickname Smiley at college, and when sentencing Osei-Kofi, Judge Lynn Tayton KC said Mr Boyce \"was clearly an enthusiastic and likeable young man\".\nShe added: \"The sentence I impose in no sense is a measure of Jamel's life.\"\nThe judge continued by saying Osei-Kofi had shown remorse, but she also noted he showed \"a continued lack of understanding of the danger of carrying knives\".\nThe 2,354 days Osei-Kofi has served in prison already will be deducted from his overall sentence.\nAdditional reporting by PA Media.\nListen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

    "url": "https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2ld7r4432o",
    "content": "In October, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) sent a chartered flight carrying Indian nationals back home, marking a growing trend in deportations to India.\nThis was no ordinary flight - it was one of multiple large-scale “removal flights” carried out this year, each typically carrying more than 100 passengers. The flights were returning groups of Indian migrants who \"did not establish a legal basis to remain in the US\".\nAccording to US officials, the latest flight carrying adult men and women was routed to Punjab, close to many deportees' places of origin. No precise breakdown of hometowns was provided.\nIn the US fiscal year 2024 which ended in September, more than 1,000 Indian nationals had been repatriated by charter and commercial flights, according to Royce Bernstein Murray, assistant secretary at the US Department of Homeland Security.\n“That has been part of a steady increase in removals from the US of Indian nationals over the past few years, which corresponds with a general increase in encounters that we have seen with Indian nationals in the last few years as well,” Ms Murray told a media briefing. (Encounters refer to instances where non-citizens are stopped by US authorities while attempting to cross the country’s borders with Mexico or Canada.)\nAs the US ramps up repatriations of Indian nationals, concerns grow about how President-elect Donald Trump's immigration policies will affect them. Trump has already promised the biggest deportation of migrants in history.\nSince October 2020, US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officials have detained nearly 170,000 Indian migrants attempting unauthorised crossings at both the northern and southern land borders.\n“Though smaller than the numbers from Latin America and the Caribbean, Indian nationals represent the largest group of migrants from outside the Western Hemisphere encountered by the CBP in the past four years,” say Gil Guerra and Sneha Puri, immigration analysts at Niskanen Center, a Washington-based think tank.\nAs of 2022, an estimated 725,000 undocumented Indian immigrants were in the US, making them the third-largest group after those from Mexico and El Salvador, according to new data from the Pew Research Center. Unauthorised immigrants in all make up 3% of US’s total population and 22% of the foreign-born population.\nLooking at the data, Mr Guerra and Ms Puri have identified notable trends in the spike in Indians attempting illegal border crossings.\nFor one, the migrants are not from the lowest economic strata. But they cannot secure tourist or student visas to the US, often due to lower education or English proficiency.\nInstead, they rely on agencies charging up to $100,000 (£79,000), sometimes using long and arduous routes designed to dodge border controls. To afford this, many sell farms or take out loans. Not surprisingly, data from the US immigration courts in 2024 reveals that the majority of Indian migrants were male, aged 18-34.\nSecond, Canada on the northern border has become a more accessible entry point for Indians, with a visitor visa processing time of 76 days (compared to up to a year for a US visa in India).\nThe Swanton Sector - covering the states of Vermont and counties in New York and New Hampshire - has experienced a sudden surge in encounters with Indian nationals since early this year, peaking at 2,715 in June, the researchers found.\nEarlier, most irregular Indian migrants entered the Americas through the busier southern border with Mexico via El Salvador or Nicaragua, both of which facilitated migration. Until November last year, Indian nationals enjoyed visa-free travel to El Salvador.\n“The US-Canada border is also longer and less guarded than the US-Mexico border. And while it is not necessarily safer, criminal groups do not have the same presence there as they do along the route from South and Central America,” Mr Guerra and Ms Puri say.\nThirdly, much of the migration appears to originate from the Sikh-dominated Indian state of Punjab and neighbouring Haryana, which has traditionally seen people migrating overseas. The other source of origin is Gujarat, the home state of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.\nPunjab, which accounts for a large share of irregular Indian migrants, is facing economic hardships, including high unemployment, farming distress and a looming drug crisis.\nMigration has also long been common among Punjabis, with rural youth still eager to move abroad.\nA recent study of 120 respondents in Punjab by Navjot Kaur, Gaganpreet Kaur and Lavjit Kaur found that 56% emigrated between ages 18-28, often after secondary education. Many funded their move through non-institutional loans, later sending remittances to their families.\nThen there has been a rise in tensions over the separatist Khalistan movement, which seeks to establish an independent homeland for Sikhs. “This has caused fear from some Sikhs in India about being unfairly targeted by authorities or politicians. These fears may also provide a credible basis for claims of persecution that allows them to seek asylum, whether or not true,” says Ms Puri.\nBut pinning down the exact triggers for migration is challenging.\n“While motivations vary, economic opportunity remains the primary driver, reinforced by social networks and a sense of pride in having family members 'settled' in the US,” says Ms Puri.\nFourth, researchers found a shift in the family demographics of Indian nationals at the borders.\nMore families are trying to cross the border. In 2021, single adults were overwhelmingly detained at both borders. Now, family units make up 16-18% of the detentions at both borders.\nThis has sometimes led to tragic consequences. In January 2022, an Indian family of four - part of a group of 11 people from Gujarat - froze to death just 12m (39ft) from the border in Canada while attempting to enter the US.\nPablo Bose, a migration and urban studies scholar at the University of Vermont, says Indians are trying to cross into the US in larger numbers because of more economic opportunities and “more ability to enter the informal economies in the US cities”, especially the large ones like New York or Boston.\n“From everything I know and interviews I have conducted, most of the Indians are not staying in the more rural locations like Vermont or upstate New York but rather heading to the cities as soon as they can,” Mr Bose told the BBC. There, he says, they are entering mostly informal jobs like domestic labour and restaurant work.\nThings are likely to become more difficult soon. Veteran immigration official Tom Homan, who will be in charge of the country's borders following Trump's inauguration in January, has said that the northern border with Canada is a priority because illegal migration in the area is a “huge national security issue”.\nWhat happens next is unclear. “It remains to be seen if Canada would impose similar policies to prevent people migrating into the US from its borders. If that happens, we can expect a decline in detentions of Indians nationals at the border,” says Ms Puri.\nWhatever the case, the dreams driving thousands of desperate Indians to seek a better life in the US are unlikely to fade, even as the road ahead becomes more perilous.\nThe former House speaker suffered an unspecified injury while on an official trip to Luxembourg, her office says.\nPersistent rain means only 13.2 overs are possible on the opening day of the third Test between Australia and India in Brisbane.\nIndia marks the centenary of Raj Kapoor, who would have turned 100 on Saturday, with celebratory events.\nThe Grammy and Emmy winner sued the British TV producer a year ago. He described her claims as \"an appalling smear\".\nThe US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Fly-half Finn Russell scored Scotland's fourth and final try\nScotland head coach Gregor Townsend was left frustrated by aspects of his side's performance in their 27-13 Autumn Nations Series win over Australia, but praised the way his players \"found a way to win\".\nMuch of the talk in the build-up to this game was about how Scotland needed to end the year with a positive result - the type of fixture they have to win to \"be taken seriously\", as Huw Jones put it.\nCaptain Sione Tuipulotu's try put Scotland in front at half-time after a largely underwhelming first 40 minutes, but they upped their game after the interval and crossed for three magnificent tries from Duhan van der Merwe, Josh Bayliss and Finn Russell.\nUltimately, the Scots did what they had to do, turning it on at key moments against a Wallabies side high on confidence after wins against England and Wales.\n\"There was more in us,\" Townsend said. \"We weren't as accurate in the first half.\n\"It shows we can get a win when we're not playing as well. There were moments in the game that I loved. We're better than some of the aspects today, but I'm proud that the players found a way to win.\n\"I'm inwardly happy, but if there was a game next week it would be a tough review and there would be a lot of things to improve.\"\nScots end autumn with statement win over Australia\nListen to BBC Scotland's Rugby Podcast\nSubscribe to our dedicated Scottish Rugby page\nIt was noticeable how Scotland turned it up a level in the second half, and although Townsend felt the performance fell short of the levels they reached in the defeat by South Africa earlier this month, he credited his player's physical output.\n\"The composure we had in defence close to our line was on show,\" he said. \"I felt our fitness as well in the second half, we outworked the defence and that created chances for us.\"\nWith the 2025 Six Nations the next focus for Scotland, Townsend was asked if he feels his side are ready to kick on and compete after the autumn they have had.\n\"The frustrations of the [2024] Six Nations - to be in every game and not come through with more than two wins - shows they were ready back then and I believe that experience has made us better,\" he said.\n\"We have to grow again in the next campaign.\"\nScotland captain Sione Tuipulotu's grandmother Jacqueline was in the stands at Murrayfield on Saturday\nFor Tuipulotu, captaining his adopted country against the nation of his birth was given additional meaning by the presence in the crowd of his grandmother Jacqueline, who had flown over earlier this week to surprise both Sione and his brother Mosese, who featured for Scotland A against Chile on Saturday.\nJacqueline - born in Greenock - is the reason both Tuipulotu brothers are eligible to play for Scotland, and she gave her grandson a hug as he received the Hopetoun Cup post-match.\n\"It was an amazing moment,\" Sione said. \"When she handed over the cup she said 'you got 'em!'\n\"I'm super happy and it makes the day all worthwhile, when we win like that. We won playing our rugby, we scored some brilliant tries. We know how dangerous our back three is but it was a group effort today and that's what I'm most pleased about.\n\"We knew we needed a win today, nothing less.

    "content": "Bashar al-Assad and his family have arrived in Moscow and been granted asylum \"out of humanitarian considerations\", Russian news agencies are quoting a Kremlin source as saying.\nRussian state TV also reported the news, which put an end to speculation about the whereabouts of Syria's former president after rebel forces seized control of Damascus.\nEarlier, the Russian foreign ministry had announced that Assad \"decided to resign the presidency and left the country, giving instructions for a peaceful transfer of power\".\nRussia, which has two key military bases in Syria, is a staunch ally of Assad and had intervened in Syria's 13-year civil war in an effort to keep him in power.\nBut it was unable to stop the collapse of his government in the face of a lightning rebel offensive that took advantage of his other key allies, Iran and Lebanon's Hezbollah movement, being distracted by other conflicts.\nAssad has not been pictured since he met the Iranian foreign minister in Damascus a week ago. That day, he vowed to \"crush\" the rebels seizing territory with dizzying speed.\nEarly on Sunday morning, after their fighters entered the city without resistance, the Islamist militant group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) and its allies declared that \"the tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled\".\nWith no official confirmation from the Syrian presidency, military or state media, rumours swirled about Assad's whereabouts.\nThe head of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR), a UK-based monitoring group, reported that a plane believed to be carrying Assad \"left Syria via Damascus international airport before the army security forces left\" the facility. Rami Abdul Rahman said he had information that the plane was meant to take off at 22:00 (20:00 GMT) on Saturday.\nPeople also followed flights in and out of Damascus to work out when Assad might have left and where he might have gone.\nReuters news agency cited two unnamed senior Syrian army officers as saying that Assad had boarded a Syrian Air plane at Damascus airport early on Sunday.\nIt noted that a Syrian Air Ilyushin Il-76T cargo plane took off from the airport at 03:59 local time (01:59 GMT) with an undisclosed destination.\nAccording to data from Flightradar24, the plane initially flew towards the Mediterranean coast, which is a stronghold of Assad's Alawite sect and is also home to two key Russian military bases - Hmeimim airbase and the naval base in Tartous.\nBut after flying over Homs, the plane made a U-turn and started flying eastwards again while also losing altitude. The plane's signal was lost at around 04:39 (02:39 GMT), when it was about 13km (8 miles) west of Homs and flying at an altitude of only 1,625ft (495m).\nIt was not clear what happened to the plan, but Flightradar24 said the aircraft \"was old with an older transponder generation, so some data might be bad or missing\", that it was \"flying in an area of GPS jamming, so some data might be bad\", and that the aircraft tracker was not aware of any airports in the area where the signal was lost. There were also no reports of any plane crashes.\nData from Flightradar24 also showed that a Russian military plane took off on Sunday from Latakia's international airport, next to Hmeimim, and flew to Moscow. Once again, it was not known who was on board.\nAs well as reporting the arrival of Assad in Moscow, Russian state TV said Russian officials were in contact with representatives of \"the Syrian armed opposition\" and that they had guaranteed the security of Russian military bases and diplomatic missions.\nRussia insisted its air strikes only targeted \"terrorists\" during its nine-year air campaign in support of Assad, but they regularly killed civilians and destroyed civilian infrastructure.\nThe SOHR said in September that more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, had been killed in Russian military operations.\nThe BBC speaks to men released from Saydnaya prison - a place known as the \"human slaughterhouse\".\nMr Timmerman has said he was on a religious \"pilgrimage\", though mystery has swirled over how he came to be in Syria.\nThe BBC's Hugo Bachega sees Syrians dancing, waving flags and making peace signs in Aleppo.\n\"I feel like I'm in a dream and I don't want to wake up,\" says Amr Shayah who fled Syria following the civil war in 2011.\nThe ex-Labour leader says there was \"no clear plan\" when MPs were asked to vote for military action against Syria in 2013.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

And it needs the\ndetermination to see through the necessary reduction in state spending â which\nit wonât have.\n\"So I expect to see several\nmore motions of censure, and several more falls of government â before\neventually we start to wake up.\"\nAdam GoldsmithLive reporter\nIn an event not seen in France since 1962, the French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has been ousted following a no-confidence vote.\nOpposition parties had called today's vote after Barnier attempted to force through his budget without parliamentary consent.\nThe French PM told MPs that kicking him out would not solve the country's financial problems. Marine Le Pen, the leader of the far-right National Rally disagreed, describing his budget as \"toxic\".\nAnd today, left and far-right parties united to cast 331 votes to seal Barnier's fate.\nThere's now the prospect of months of turmoil in France - it took Emmanuel Macron two months to appoint Barnier, who only lasted a little longer in the role himself following his appointment in September.\nThe prime minister is set to tender his resignation tomorrow morning, but may stay on until Macron finds a successor.\nWe're wrapping up our live coverage shortly, but you can continue to read the full details in our main story, and read an article about how this is a moment of opportunity and risk for Marine Le Pen.\nAlso, see Katya Adler's piece on why France's turmoil is a grave concern for the rest of Europe.\nThanks for joining us.\n\"France is entering an episode of turmoil,\" former\nNational Assembly member Jacques Myard tells BBC News.\n\"We are heading for regime crisis.\"\nMyard - who served as a National Assembly member for 24 years\nand was a member of the right-wing Republicans - says that those who engineered\nthe vote against Michel Barnier \"will do everything they can to push\nMacron out\".\n\"We are entering a very difficult time,\" he says, and\nFrance faces an uncertain future.\n\"I cannot tell you what will happen tomorrow morning.\"\nHugh SchofieldParis Correspondent\nFor many todayâs vote is a crise de rÃ©gime which is being played\nout, with the very future of the Fifth Republic institutions in jeopardy.\nThe Fifth Republic was created to concentrate power in the hands\nof Charles de Gaulle at a time of national crisis. And ever since De Gaulle,\npresidents have tried â and generally failed â to emulate his stature.\nMacron certainly liked to compare himself with le grand Charles.\nBut when De Gaulle had a similar government crisis in 1962, he\nwent to the people and received a huge popular mandate in the next election.\nMacron has done the reverse. He has had his vote â the botched\nelection in July â and lost it. Power has now shifted out of his hands into\nthose of the putative prime minister, answerable to parliament.\nBut just as the country reverts to being more of a parliamentary\nsystem, the assembly itself has proved itself incapable of action.\nAs more than one commentator\nhas pointed out, France â with its monarchical instincts and top-down\nconception of power â has never developed a culture of compromise.\nHugh SchofieldParis Correspondent\nNormally when a democratic country passes through turbulence, there is some prospect of the turbulence coming to an end.\nNot today in Paris. If anything, the downfall of Michel Barnier â toppled in parliament by a no-confidence motion â threatens to set a pattern for what lies ahead.\nFor if Michel Barnier â a moderate of the centre-right with a reputation for courtesy and compromise â was unable to pass a budget, then who else can?\nThe original cause of the crisis has not gone away.  It is the division since July of the National Assembly into three roughly equal blocs, none of which is prepared to deal with another.\nAs a result the two blocs that make up the opposition will always be able to unseat the one bloc that forms a government.\nAdd to that a mood of near-insurrection on some opposition benches â plus an ideological push for ever more generous spending pledges, despite stark warnings about the national debt â and the idea of a return to serene central politics seems very distant.\nFrench political analyst Salome Saque tells the BBC News Channel \"the vote was expected but unprecedented\".\nâWe are deeper into a political crisis that we were already facing,\" she says.\nAs the budget will not pass, Saque says the government \"will need to pass some special laws for specific areas in the economy so the country can keep moving\".\nThe political parties are positioning themselves for elections in 2027, she adds.\n\"They care more about how they are seen than what they are doing,\" she says, adding \"the winner is the far right in France.\"\nThe BBC has been speaking to Fabrice Leggeri, an MEP from Marine Le Penâs far-right National Rally party.\nHe says his party doesnât want to take on prime ministerial responsibilities now it's vacant and it had the interest of French citizens in mind when\nit voted in favour of ousting Michel Barnier.\nâOur reading of the budget law was that it was very bad for\nFrench people, bad for the French economy, without any solution to streamline\nadministrative services and public service in order to cut bad spending.â\nLeggeri says his party expects the next prime minister\nwill not only be \"polite\" with the National Rally, but will take the partyâs viewpoint\non board as much as possible â something he claims Michael Barnier did not do.\nMathilde Panot\nSoon after the result of the no-confidence vote on PM Michel Barnier's government politicians from across the political spectrum spoke to reporters.\nMathilde Panot, who heads the left-wing opposition party France Unbowed (LFI), says \"today is a historic day\" as Barnier's government and the \"violent budget\" have fallen.\nNow, Panot adds, \"we are calling on Macron to go\" as she repeated calls for early presidential elections.\nThis video can not be played\nMarine Le Pen calls budget that led to PM Barnier's downfall 'toxic'\nMarine Le Pen, leader of France's far-right National Rally party, says the budget that led to PM Michel Barnier's downfall was \"toxic for the French\".\n\"The only dignified solution for those who were given the mandate to protect them, was to oppose this budget,\" she adds.\nIn an interview with French broadcaster TF1 Le Pen says there was \"no other solution\" than to oust Barnier from his post.\nAsked about the French president's prospects, Le Pen says: \"I am not asking for the resignation of Emmanuel Macron.\"\nHowever, she adds, that there will \"come a time when, if we do not respect the voice of voters and show respect for political forces and respect for elections,\" then pressure on the president will \"obviously be stronger and stronger\".\nThe French President will give a televised speech to the nation at 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) on Thursday, the ÃlysÃ©e presidential palace says.\nEmmanuel Macron, who has just returned to France following a state visit to Saudi Arabia, has previously said he would not resign whatever the outcome of Wednesday's vote.\nJean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, who leads the far-left France Unbowed - part of the broader left alliance which tabled the no confidence vote - has taken to X to express his pleasure that the \"inevitable censorship\" has passed and Barnier's government has fallen.\n\"Even with a Barnier every three months, Macron will not last three years,\" he added, in reference to President Macron's remaining time in office.\nThe next presidential elections are due by April 2027, but ahead of the no-confidence vote some had called for Macron to resign.\nHugh SchofieldParis correspondent\nA majority of 288 ballots was needed. In the end MPs from the\nleft-wing bloc and from Marine Le Penâs National Rally combined to reach a\ntotal of 331.\nAs a result Michel Barnier is now obliged to present the\nresignation of his government, and the budget which was the cause of his\ndownfall is now defunct.\nIt's a worrying moment for France, because there is no obvious\nprospect of the political crisis being resolved any time soon.\nNo new parliamentary elections can be held until July, so the\ncurrent deadlock in the Assembly where no group can hope to have a working\nmajority is set to continue.\nNonetheless, President Macron is expected to act fast to appoint\na new man or woman to form a government â not least because US President elect\nDonald Trump is due in Paris this weekend for the re-opening of Notre Dame\ncathedral, and Macron does not want the embarrassment of a non-existent\ngovernment.\nMPs voted overwhelmingly in support of the motion against Barnier - by 331 votes - just three months after he was appointed by President Emmanuel Macron.\nMPs were not able to vote against it and could only vote for, or abstain.\nThis video can not be played\nWatch: Barnier loses no-confidence vote\nFrance's PM Michel Barnier has been ousted as left and far right parties unite to vote in support of a motion of no confidence.\nIt marks the first time the France's government has collapsed in a no-confidence vote since 1962.\n\nLaura GozziEurope reporter\nIf the motion of no-confidence passes this would lead to the fall of the French government - the first time it has collapsed to a no-confidence vote since 1962.\nIf this happens, Barnier is likely to stay on as caretaker as France's President Emmanuel Macron chooses a successor.\nThis was no easy task in the summer, when it took Macron two months to choose a name that wouldn't immediately be shot down by one of the large parliamentary factions.\nThere's also a possibility that Macron appoints an unelected technocrat government - but this likely wouldn't last long as they struggle to be seen as legitimate.\nWe do know for sure that a new election is not an option. Under the French constitution they cannot be called within a year of the previous polls, which in this case took place last July.\nNow that the prime minister's speech has ended, voting has begun\non whether to censure him and remove him from his post.\nThe session of the\nNational Assembly should resume at about 20:20 local time (19:20 GMT) at which point we're likely to hear the result.\nThe prime minister now says that he is \"not afraid\" of being voted out, and has \"rarely been afraid\" in his long political career.\nMichel Barnier says what is most important \"is our capacity to take steps towards each other\" and to \"go above the general interest\" to take steps forward, whether they are big or small.\nHe says that if he is kept in power, he is willing to work constructively with anyone who seeks these aims.\nEnding his speech, Barnier says it has \"been an honour\" to have served as prime minister, even if it was only for a matter of months and that it would continue to be an honour, despite the outcome of the vote.\nThe prime minister then receives a standing ovation.\nThe prime minister is speaking now in the National Assembly,\ntelling those present that voting him out of office will not solve the\ncountry's financial problems.\n\"We have reached a moment of truth, of\nresponsibility,\" he says, adding that \"we need to look at the\nrealities of our debt\".\n\"It is not a pleasure that I propose difficult\nmeasures,\" Barnier adds.\nHe also defends pushing his budget through without parliamentary\nconsultation, saying he worked with both chambers of parliament to develop the\ndocument.\nMichel Barnier is listening to the debate inside the National Assembly\nIf you're just joining us and are catching up on the latest developments, French MPs are holding a debate in the National Assembly ahead of a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Michel Barnier.\nIt has been heated at times, with Laurent Wauquiez of the Republicans accusing the far right and radical left, which have both tabled motions of no confidence, of choosing chaos over responsibility.\nThe right and left say Barnier has failed to listen to their demands over the budget, which he pushed through on Monday without parliamentary support - resulting in today's vote.\nWe have not heard from the prime minister yet, who is sitting in the chamber, but are expecting to at some point.\nVoting is expected to start soon - some time after 19:00 local time (18:00 GMT). MPs will then have 45 minutes to cast their vote. They must either vote yes or abstain.\nIf 288 MPs votes in support of the motion, Barnier will lose his job and his government will collapse.\nStay with us as we bring you all the latest updates.\nLaura GozziEurope reporter\nVoting will start some time after 19:00 local time (18:00 GMT). MPs will have 45 minutes to cast their vote - they can either vote in favour of the motion of no-confidence or abstain, but they cannot vote \"no\".\n288 votes are needed for the motion to be adopted and the government to collapse.\nIn total, more than 320 MPs have already committed to voting for no-confidence - so even if a handful change their minds, the motion should garner more than the required total.\nÂ© 2024 BBC.

There was a difference of around 95,000 votes between the two candidates.\n\"The country of liberty, equality and fraternity has triumphed once again,\" Orsi said in a victory speech.\n\"Let's understand that there is another part of our country who have different feelings today,\" he added. \"These people will also have to help build a better country. We need them too.\"\nMeanwhile, Delgado told supporters at his campaign headquarters in the capital of Montevideo: \"With sadness, but without guilt, we can congratulate the winner.\"\nCurrent President Luis Lacalle Pou, whose victory in 2019 ended the left-wing Broad Front alliance's 15 years in power, took to social media platform X to promise a smooth transition.\n\"I called Yamandu Orsi to congratulate him as President-elect of our country,\" Pou wrote on X, formerly Twitter.\nHe added he would put himself \"at [Orsi's] service and begin the transition as soon as I deem it appropriate.\"\nOrsi, a 57-year-old working-class former history teacher who had previously served as mayor of the capital Montevideo, is seen as the heir to former President Jose Mujica, himself a former Marxist guerilla, who drew global attention for his simple lifestyle while in office and his transformation of Uruguay into one of the most liberal and environmentally sustainable countries in the region.\nIn the lead-up to the election, issues such as years of sluggish economic growth, stagnant wages and the government's struggle to stem an upsurge in violent crime were key points of contention for voters.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nkm/rmt (AP, AFP, Reuters)"

    "content": "The Left Party has dramatically lost voter support. But for the general election in February, a trio of seniors is coming to the rescue — banking on a quirk in German electoral law.\nGermany's Left Party is struggling for survival. For many weeks, opinion polls have put them well below the 5% threshold for representation in parliament.\nNow, three of the party's most senior and most popular politicians have decided to make sure their party is represented no matter how poor the overall performance.\nOn February 23, 2025, Germany is set to hold a snap election. Germans have two votes: one for a candidate in their constituency, the other for a party. This second vote determines the number of seats a party gets in the Bundestag. Any party that scores less than 5% fails to get representation.\nHowever, an exception exists: If three party candidates win in their respective constituencies, the 5% threshold is waived.\nThis exception in electoral law came to the Left Party's aid in the 2021 federal election when it garnered only 4.9% of the vote.\nHowever, because three Left Party candidates won their constituencies, the Left was allowed to fill 4.9% of the seats in parliament and send a total of 39 MPs.\nThe Left Party hopes to pull off this rare feat once again in 2025.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nHowever, this is likely to be even more difficult this time around, as the party will likely lose many voters to the left-wing populist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), which split off from the Left Party in early 2024 and has since performed significantly better in regional elections and opinion polls.\nGregor Gysi, Bodo Ramelow and Dietmar Bartsch, all well past retirement age, may now be the best hope for a party that dates back to the communist German Democratic Republic, and is now more worried about its future than ever before.\nThey call their renewed candidacy for the Bundestag \"Mission Silver Locks\" — an ironic reference to their average age of 70.\nThe most prominent among them is Gregor Gysi, who is turning 77 years old in January. He played a pivotal role in the successful transformation of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED) in East Germany, helping it to become the Left Party as it is today.\nGysi, a former lawyer and eloquent orator, has been a member of the German Bundestag almost continuously since 1990, winning his Berlin constituency eight times by a wide margin.\nGysi believes he and his party continue to be a much-needed voice in reunified Germany. \"If arguments from the left are no longer heard in the Bundestag, debates will become a lot more limited,\" he said, adding that the Left Party was still the voice of eastern German voters more than any other party.\nThis view is also shared by Dietmar Bartsch, Gysi's decadeslong comrade and confidant. The 66-year-old comes from the northeastern region of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, where the Left Party has been part of the state government since 2021 in coalition with the center-left Social Democratic Party (SPD).\nBartsch has said there is only one left-wing party in the Bundestag: the Left Party. \"All the others tend to jockey for the center,\" he said.\nBartsch, who holds a doctorate in economics, has been a member of the Bundestag since 1998 with only a brief interruption. He has also served as the parliamentary group leader and, as managing director of the Left Party, has organized numerous electoral campaigns.\nUnlike Gysi, however, Bartsch has never won his constituency and got into parliament only via his party's state list. A victory in his constituency would, therefore, be a first.\nThe third of the three most promising Left Party candidates is Bodo Ramelow, the head of government in the eastern state of Thuringia.\nRamelow, 68, recently lost in his state's election but remains very popular. If he wins his constituency for the Left Party in the Bundestag election, it would come as no surprise.\nRamelow was a member of the Bundestag from 2005 to 2009. Now, together with Gysi and Bartsch, he wants to help his badly shaken party back into the Bundestag.\nThe Left Party's membership has an average age of 55, and only one-third of them are women. Critics have suggested that rather than banking on elderly candidates to lead the party into the future, it should embrace diversity and focus on the younger generation in the big cities.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Argentina has left UN climate talks and US President-elect Donald Trump plans to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement. So far, only a handful of countries have updated their climate targets. So, where do we stand?\nThe first week of the UN climate summit COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, is drawing to a close against a backdrop of calls for urgent action by UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and warnings by climate scientists.\nAs the world faces an escalating climate crisis with unprecedented storms, floods, droughts and wildfires, government climate action has been at a \"three-year standstill,\" according to scientists from Climate Action Tracker. The independent scientific project tracks government policies and measures them against the globally agreed Paris accord goal of holding warming well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), and pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius.\nUS President-elect Donald Trump is preparing to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement for the second time. And Argentine president and climate skeptic Javier Milei, who met with Trump on Thursday, ordered his delegates to leave the UN conference earlier this week.\nMaria Victoria Emanuelli, the Buenos Aires-based Latin America campaign director of environmental NGO 350.org, called this decision \"erratic and unpredictable,\" adding that it could cost the country a considerable financial sum needed for climate action.\n\"It's difficult to understand how a climate-vulnerable country like Argentina would cut itself from critical support,\" said Anabella Rosemberg, an Argentine working as a senior adviser at Climate Action Network International.\nMany heads of state and government, including from the US, France and Germany, are not attending the conference, which offers a platform for nations to announce more ambitious climate goals. These include emissions reduction targets and measures to achieve them.\nCountries have until February to come forward with their national targets. So far, only a few have made use of the opportunity.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said his country will aim to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 81% on 1990 levels by 2035.\n\"We are building on our reputation as a climate leader,\" he said at COP29, urging the other parties \"to come forward with ambitious targets of their own, as we all agreed at the last COP.\"\nStarmer, who took office in July after his center-left Labour Party won the general election, has promised to turn the country into \"a clean energy superpower.\" Speaking in Baku, he said the UK had closed its final coal power plant in September, making it the first G7 country to phase out energy from the fossil fuel.\nStarmer's 2035 pledge was \"a step in the right direction but must be seen as a floor to the level of ambition not a ceiling,\" Rosie Downes, head of campaigns with environmental group Friends of the Earth, said in a statement. She added that deeper and faster cuts were needed.\n\"With the warning signals flashing red, a planet battered by increasingly severe floods, storms and heat waves, and the election of climate denier President Trump, the need for climate leadership by the UK has never been more urgent,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the UK's existing 2030 commitments were still way off course, she added.\nBrazil, which will host next year's COP30, has also unveiled its climate targets. It aims to cut emissions between 59% and 67% from 2005 levels by 2035. That equals a cut of 39% to 50% from 2019 levels, environmental NGO 350.org said. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a decrease of 60% by 2035 compared to 2019 levels is necessary to stay below the 1.5 Celsius threshold.\nBrazil's decision to give a range rather than a fixed percentage figure has drawn criticism, as it creates uncertainty and weakens accountability, said Andreas Sieber, 350.org's associate director of policy and campaigns. \"The lower range is unacceptably low, while the upper limit, though a positive step, should be seen as just the starting point.\"\nEspecially in its role as COP host next year, Brazil should lead by example, said Sieber.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile the country claims its investment in the energy sector with a focus on renewable sources is placing Brazil \"at the forefront of the global energy transition,\" analysts have said the country is on track to increase oil and gas production 36% by 2035. Swiss-based research and advocacy NGO Oil Change International looked at how the \"COP troika nations\" Brazil, the United Arab Emirates and Azerbaijan — who will host, hosted or are hosting the climate talks — are doing in terms of climate action.\n\"The UAE and Brazil rank first and third in the world in terms of oil and gas expansion approved since the COP28 decision to transition away from fossil fuels,\" Oil Change International found.\nIn its updated targets published last week, the UAE said it was committing to achieving a 47% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2023, compared to 2019. While that was a slight improvement on the Gulf state's previous target of 40%, global civil society movement Climate Action Network called it \"insufficient.\"\n\"The plan doesn't include any commitment to phase out fossil fuels or to stop the expansion of fossil fuel infrastructure,\" said Mohamed Kamal, member of Climate Action Network Arab World.\n350.org called it a \"greenwashing exercise,\" adding that \"it decided to bury its bad news on the day of the US election results.\" The NGO points to the glaring omission of exported emissions — the country exports most of its oil.\n\"The UAE now leads the world in oil and gas expansion, even after assuming the role of COP president with a mandate to transition away from fossil fuels,\" said Sieber. \"This 'climate commitment' brazenly undermines its own credibility and COP presidential legacy.\"\n\"There can be no '1.5 degrees Celsius aligned' climate plans without explicit commitments to halt the production of fossil fuels and to stop generating energy from them,\" said David Knecht, co-coordinator of Climate Action Network's Ambition Working Group.\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker"

Thank you for reading. For the latest developments on the Syrian civil war, please keep reading here.\nBelow you can read developments in the Syrian civil war as they happened on Sunday, December 8:\nThe US Central Command (CENTCOM) responsible for the Middle East and other areas said its forces conducted \"dozens of precision airstrikes targeting known ISIS camps and operatives in central Syria\" on Sunday, using another common acronym for the so-called \"Islamic State\" group.\n\"The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade and defeat ISIS,\" CENTCOM said.\nIt said this was not only to prevent the terror group to conduct external operations, but also \"to ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria.\"\nCENTCOM said its aircraft, including F-15 combat jets, A-10 close air support planes, and the huge, high-altitude B-52 bomber, struck a total of more than 75 targets.\nIt said there was no preliminary indication of civilian casualties, and made no mention of combatant casualties.\n\"There should be no doubt — we will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,\" said General Michael Erik Kurilla. \"All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold them accountable if they partner with or support ISIS in any way.\"\nWar monitors report continued fighting for control of the region and city of Manbij, as Turkish-allied rebels advance on Kurdish forces that Turkey considers terrorists but that were also key western allies in the fight against ISIS in Syria in recent years.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebel forces had taken control of large areas of the city and that clashes were known to have killed 26 people — nine Turkish-allied rebels and 17 members of the Manbij military forces.\nThe military leadership of the Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) holding Manbij is the YPG, a Kurdish group which Turkey considers a terrorist group with close ties to the Kurdish PKK independence movement that is outlawed in Turkey.\nReuters cited a Turkish security source, who it did not name, as saying that attacks continued by air and on land.\n\"The fight against the YPG/PKK is very close to victory. Both air and land interventions are ongoing to take Manbij from the hands of the YPG/PKK,\" the source was quoted as saying.\nHe said Turkish-backed forces controlled around 80% of the Manbij region and had entered the city proper.\nWhile Turkey sees the YPG as allied to the PKK — also labeled a terrorist group by the US — Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria were key allies in the US-led mission to eliminate ISIS from the area a few years ago.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSupporters of the Syrian opposition entered the the country's embassy in Athens on Sunday and hoisted an opposition flag from its roof.\nPolice intervened and detained four individuals but also left the flag flying.\nIn Madrid in Spain, a crowd of around 150 people chanted \"freedom\" as a man replaced the Syrian regime flag with that of the rebel fighters.\nSeveral opposition supporters also gathered outside the Syrian embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, hoisting a rebel flag and also ripping up photos of Assad.\nMillions have been displaced by the years of fighting in Syria, many of them fleeing the country if they can.\nMeanwhile, in Syria, the Iranian embassy was visible damaged, with paintings of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei smashed and flags on the ground outside the building.\nItaly's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also said that rebel forces entered the residence of Italy's ambassador in Damascus on Sunday.\nHe said they were looking for Assad forces and relevant documents and that they fired a few shots against the wall but did not harm the ambassador or security staff.\n\"They only took away three cars and that was it,\" Tajani said.\nJordan's King Abdullah II said on Sunday that his government \"stands by its Syrian brothers and respects their will and choices\" in a statement.\nHe urged the avoidance of any \"conflict that may lead to chaos\" and stressed the need to maintain security in Jordan's neighbor to the north after its security forces crumbled.\nQatar's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, called for a political process to begin under UN Security Council Resolution 2254 —  a resolution laying out steps for a ceasefire and political transition reached at the height of Syria's civil war in 2015 that never gained purchase at the time.\nThe ministry said it was following developments closely and called for the preservation of Syria as a single state.\nEgypt echoed this, calling on all parties in Syria to preserve the capabilities of the state and national institutions.\nReuters news agency cited an unnamed Saudi official as saying that the country was in \"constant communication\" with other relevant countries.\n\"We have been in contact with all actors in the region. We are in constant communication with Turkey and every stakeholder involved,\" he was quoted as saying.\nIraqi government spokesperson Bassem Al-Awadi said Iraq also reaffirmed the importance of not interfering in the internal affairs of Syria, or supporting one party in favor of another.\nOutgoing US President Joe Biden has said that the US intends to \"engage with all Syrian groups\" regarding the transition of power.\nSpeaking from the White House, Biden said Washington would assess the statements made by the leaders of the rebel groups who led the offensive which ousted Assad. He went on to warn that some Syrian rebel groups had a \"grim record of terrorism.\"\n\"We will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime toward independent, sovereign\" Syria \"with a new constitution.\"\nBiden credited action by Washington and its allies for weakening Assad's backers Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.\n\"Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,\" he said, echoing earlier statements from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had called Assad's fall a \"direct result of the blows we inflicted on Hezbollah.\"\n\"The US will support Syria's neighbors in the period of transition,\" Biden said, amid growing uncertainties in the Middle East region given Israel's war in Gaza and its shaky ceasefire in Lebanon.\nHe described Assad's fall as a \"fundamental act of justice\" while also being a \"moment of risk and uncertainty.\"\nBiden said the US was unsure of Assad's whereabouts, while acknowledging reports he was seeking asylum in Russia.\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Assad's rapid fall carried with it a broader reminder applicable to the Syrian leader's backer Russia.\n\"The events in Syria have made the world realize once again, or at least they should have, that even the most cruel regime may fall and that Russia and its allies can be defeated,\" Tusk wrote online.\nEU and NATO member Poland has been a staunch backer of Ukraine, both before and after Tusk's coalition returned to power in October 2023. It's also a crucial logistics hub for military aid to its neighbor Ukraine.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) war monitor said on Sunday that it had registered a total of 910 deaths since the start of the rebel operation in late November.\nThe SOHR said it had \"documented, since the launch of the ... [rebel] operation on November 27, 910 people killed.\"\nIt said this tally included 138 civilians, 380 Syrian troops and allied fighters, and 392 rebels.\nThe figure pointed to the minimal resistance attacking forces appear to have faced during their advance through Aleppo, Hama and Homs en route to Damascus, although the figure may also be incomplete.\nBy contrast, estimates vary, but most believe half a million or more have died during the entirety of Syria's civil war that began after anti-Assad protests in 2011.\nRussian media outlets including news agency Tass have reported, citing unnamed Kremlin sources, that Bashar Assad is in Moscow.\n\"Assad and members of his family arrived in Moscow. Russia, based on humanitarian considerations, granted them asylum,\" Tass quoted an unnamed Kremlin source as saying.\nA spokesman for Israel's IDF military urged residents of several Syrian towns in the demilitarized buffer zone of the Golan Heights near the de facto border to stay indoors.\n\"Urgent warning to the residents of southern Syria,\" Avichay Adraee wrote in a statement in Arabic, listing five Syrian towns in the buffer zone.\n\"The fighting inside your area is forcing the IDF to act and we do not intend to harm you. For your safety, you must stay at home and not go out until further notice,\" he wrote.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz had earlier said that IDF troops had seized a \"buffer zone and control points to ensure the protection of all Israeli communities in the Golan Heights — Jewish and Druze — so that they are not exposed to the threats from the other side.\"\nHe said the military took this step after Syrian troops abandoned their positions amid the regime collapse.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the cruel Assad dictatorship has collapsed\" in a response online, but also offered a note of caution.\n\"This historic change in the region offers opportunities but is not without risks,\" she said.\n\"Europe is ready to support safeguarding national unity and rebuilding a Syrian state that protects all minorities,\" she said.\nAssad is an Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and not a member of the majority Sunni Muslim population in Syria. Around three-quarters of Syria's population are Sunnis, but the country has meaningful Shiite, Druze and Christian minority populations.\nHTS's leaders have pledged to ensure all minorities are respected under a new regime, but some observers have concerns about the offshoot of an al-Qaeda branch.\nVon der Leyen said that officials in Brussels were \"engaging with European and regional leaders and monitoring developments.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha focused on Russia's role, or rather its reduced role in Syria amid its invasion of Ukraine, when responding to Assad's fall.\n\"Assad has fallen,\" Sybiha said online. \"This is how it has always been and will always be for dictators who bet on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him.\"\nRussian backing, particularly from the skies, had contributed considerably to Assad's forces reclaiming control of the bulk of the war torn country in recent years.\nBut Russia's military footprint in Syria has reduced amid its invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine's Sybiha called for all efforts to be made \"to stabilize the region and ensure inclusive political dialogue in Syria for the sake of effectively functioning state institutions.\"\n\"We express our readiness to pave the way to restoring relations in the future and reaffirm support for the Syrian people,\" he concluded.\nAssad's Syria had cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine in July 2022, a few months after the war with Russia began.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for all sides to protect Syrian civilians and ensure aid can reach those in need after Assad's sudden fall.\n\"The developments in Syria in recent hours and days are unprecedented, and we are speaking to our partners in the region and monitoring the situation closely,\" Starmer said.\n\"The Syrian people have suffered under Assad's barbaric regime for too long and we welcome his departure. Our focus is now on ensuring a political solution prevails and stability is restored,\" he said.\nStarmer also joined several other world leaders in urging all sides to \"protect civilians and minorities,\" as well as ensuring that \"essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days.\"\nThe head of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, said that there is no room for turning back after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime.\n\"The future is ours and we are moving toward victory,\" al-Golani said in a statement read on Syrian state TV, after arriving in the capital Damascus.\nVideos shared on social media purportedly showed al-Golani kneeling down upon arriving in Damascus.\n\"We continue to work with determination to achieve the goals of our revolution... We are determined to complete the path we started in 2011,\" he said.\nSyria descended into civil war after a brutal government crackdown on the 2011 pro-democracy protests.\nWhile the war had been considered \"frozen\" for years, rebel groups made significant advances in a lightning offensive in recent days and then ousted Assad on Sunday.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Ankara would help ensure Syria's \"unity, integrity and security\" following Bashar Assad's ouster.\n\"Turkey is ready to take responsibility for all that is necessary to heal Syria's wounds and guarantee its unity, integrity and security,\" Fidan said.\n\"We will further intensify our work on this matter with countries in the region and with international actors in the coming days,\" he said.\nFidan said that he hoped millions of Syrians who were forced to flee the country would be able to return home. Turkey has taken in some 3.5 million Syrian refugees.\nIn earlier comments at a press conference in Doha, Qatar, Fidan called for Syria's opposition to remain united and warned against a \"desire for revenge.\"\nTurkey has launched several military incursions into northern Syria throughout the civil war in order to push back the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers to be a terrorist organization.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video"

    "content": "French Prime Minister Michel Barnier's minority government has become the shortest-lived since the 1958 establishment of the Fifth Republic. It's not clear if his replacement will fare any better in a hung parliament.\nDW's correspondent in Paris Lisa Louis said that even if Macron appoints a new prime minister quickly, perhaps within 24 hours, as his camp has indicated is likely, the same issues will likely plague Barnier's successor.\n\"This of course will not be the end of France's problems,\" Louis said. \"There's a huge political crisis: a hung parliament here, with three blocs, none of these three blocs has a majority in parliament.

    "content": "On X, Elon Musk, among others, expressed outrage over a €18,000 fine for a statement made by German state politician Detlef Gürth. But Musk's repost left out a decisive part of what Gürth said.\nA German politician's comments about migrants on social media platform X, made after an Afghan national committed a violent crime in a small German town, led to a court-issued fine. The court's actions received criticism online, which caught the attention of billionaire and X owner Elon Musk.\nThe original postfrom November 14, which was shared by Musk on X, was viewed more than 20 million times by the time this article was completed. The repost by Musk garnered almost as many views. DW Fact Check took a closer look at the post's claims about the case of conservative German state politician Detlef Gürth.\nClaim: The post on X states: \"German politician Detlef Gürth was fined €18,000 for posting this: 'We feed them (migrants), they stab us.' In the West, you are no longer allowed to say anything.\"\nDW Fact check: False\nThe penalty for the member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) was issued by the Aschersleben District Court not solely because of the cited sentence. The statement that Gürth had posted on X was longer and made racist remarks about migrants.\nThe Magdeburg Regional Court, responsible for press inquiries, explained to DW: \"The subject of the penalty order is not just one sentence. It is about the overall impression of several sentences from the so-called 'tweet' of 15.06.2024.\"\nSo, what exactly did the post say? In the now-deleted but still accessible postDetlef Gürth wrote: \"Good that the police shot this cowardly, devious Afghan. We feed them, and then they murder innocent people. This pack must be removed from Germany.\"\nThe CDU state parliament member and former president of the state parliament of Saxony-Anhalt was referring to the knife attack by a 27-year-old Afghan in June in Wolmirstedt. The man had broken into a property in a residential neighborhood and attacked three people at a private Euro 2024 party with a knife. He had previously attacked another Afghan, who later succumbed to his injuries.\nIn the opinion of the Halle public prosecutor's office, the statements legally fulfill \"All the characteristics of incitement to hatred.\" As the central office in Saxony-Anhalt, the Halle public prosecutor's office is responsible for combating hate crime on the internet. The Aschersleben District Court agreed with the public prosecutor’s assessment and issued a penalty order of 90 daily rates of €200 each.\nThe Magdeburg district court did not wish to comment on further issues in the Gürth case for the time being, as the proceedings have not yet been concluded and the verdict is not yet legally binding. Gürth can still appeal. The 62-year-old has already announced that he will do so.\nEdited by: Rachel Baig"

DW has the latest.\nSyrian rebels have entered Damascus, announcing curfew starting 4 p.m. local time\nRussian media report that President Assad has arrived in Moscow after being granted amnesty, though this is yet to be formally announced\nSyria's prime minister has said he is prepared for a peaceful transition\nA war monitor said government forces left Damascus airport\nThese live updates have been closed. Thank you for reading. For the latest developments on the Syrian civil war, please keep reading here.\nBelow you can read developments in the Syrian civil war as they happened on Sunday, December 8:\nThe US Central Command (CENTCOM) responsible for the Middle East and other areas said its forces conducted \"dozens of precision airstrikes targeting known ISIS camps and operatives in central Syria\" on Sunday, using another common acronym for the so-called \"Islamic State\" group.\n\"The strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps were conducted as part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade and defeat ISIS,\" CENTCOM said.\nIt said this was not only to prevent the terror group to conduct external operations, but also \"to ensure that ISIS does not seek to take advantage of the current situation to reconstitute in central Syria.\"\nCENTCOM said its aircraft, including F-15 combat jets, A-10 close air support planes, and the huge, high-altitude B-52 bomber, struck a total of more than 75 targets.\nIt said there was no preliminary indication of civilian casualties, and made no mention of combatant casualties.\n\"There should be no doubt — we will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,\" said General Michael Erik Kurilla. \"All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold them accountable if they partner with or support ISIS in any way.\"\nWar monitors report continued fighting for control of the region and city of Manbij, as Turkish-allied rebels advance on Kurdish forces that Turkey considers terrorists but that were also key western allies in the fight against ISIS in Syria in recent years.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said rebel forces had taken control of large areas of the city and that clashes were known to have killed 26 people — nine Turkish-allied rebels and 17 members of the Manbij military forces.\nThe military leadership of the Syria Democratic Forces (SDF) holding Manbij is the YPG, a Kurdish group which Turkey considers a terrorist group with close ties to the Kurdish PKK independence movement that is outlawed in Turkey.\nReuters cited a Turkish security source, who it did not name, as saying that attacks continued by air and on land.\n\"The fight against the YPG/PKK is very close to victory. Both air and land interventions are ongoing to take Manbij from the hands of the YPG/PKK,\" the source was quoted as saying.\nHe said Turkish-backed forces controlled around 80% of the Manbij region and had entered the city proper.\nWhile Turkey sees the YPG as allied to the PKK — also labeled a terrorist group by the US — Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria were key allies in the US-led mission to eliminate ISIS from the area a few years ago.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSupporters of the Syrian opposition entered the the country's embassy in Athens on Sunday and hoisted an opposition flag from its roof.\nPolice intervened and detained four individuals but also left the flag flying.\nIn Madrid in Spain, a crowd of around 150 people chanted \"freedom\" as a man replaced the Syrian regime flag with that of the rebel fighters.\nSeveral opposition supporters also gathered outside the Syrian embassy in Belgrade, Serbia, hoisting a rebel flag and also ripping up photos of Assad.\nMillions have been displaced by the years of fighting in Syria, many of them fleeing the country if they can.\nMeanwhile, in Syria, the Iranian embassy was visible damaged, with paintings of Ayatollah Ali Khamenei smashed and flags on the ground outside the building.\nItaly's Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani also said that rebel forces entered the residence of Italy's ambassador in Damascus on Sunday.\nHe said they were looking for Assad forces and relevant documents and that they fired a few shots against the wall but did not harm the ambassador or security staff.\n\"They only took away three cars and that was it,\" Tajani said.\nJordan's King Abdullah II said on Sunday that his government \"stands by its Syrian brothers and respects their will and choices\" in a statement.\nHe urged the avoidance of any \"conflict that may lead to chaos\" and stressed the need to maintain security in Jordan's neighbor to the north after its security forces crumbled.\nQatar's Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, called for a political process to begin under UN Security Council Resolution 2254 —  a resolution laying out steps for a ceasefire and political transition reached at the height of Syria's civil war in 2015 that never gained purchase at the time.\nThe ministry said it was following developments closely and called for the preservation of Syria as a single state.\nEgypt echoed this, calling on all parties in Syria to preserve the capabilities of the state and national institutions.\nReuters news agency cited an unnamed Saudi official as saying that the country was in \"constant communication\" with other relevant countries.\n\"We have been in contact with all actors in the region. We are in constant communication with Turkey and every stakeholder involved,\" he was quoted as saying.\nIraqi government spokesperson Bassem Al-Awadi said Iraq also reaffirmed the importance of not interfering in the internal affairs of Syria, or supporting one party in favor of another.\nOutgoing US President Joe Biden has said that the US intends to \"engage with all Syrian groups\" regarding the transition of power.\nSpeaking from the White House, Biden said Washington would assess the statements made by the leaders of the rebel groups who led the offensive which ousted Assad. He went on to warn that some Syrian rebel groups had a \"grim record of terrorism.\"\n\"We will engage with all Syrian groups, including within the process led by the United Nations, to establish a transition away from the Assad regime toward independent, sovereign\" Syria \"with a new constitution.\"\nBiden credited action by Washington and its allies for weakening Assad's backers Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.\n\"Our approach has shifted the balance of power in the Middle East,\" he said, echoing earlier statements from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had called Assad's fall a \"direct result of the blows we inflicted on Hezbollah.\"\n\"The US will support Syria's neighbors in the period of transition,\" Biden said, amid growing uncertainties in the Middle East region given Israel's war in Gaza and its shaky ceasefire in Lebanon.\nHe described Assad's fall as a \"fundamental act of justice\" while also being a \"moment of risk and uncertainty.\"\nBiden said the US was unsure of Assad's whereabouts, while acknowledging reports he was seeking asylum in Russia.\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Assad's rapid fall carried with it a broader reminder applicable to the Syrian leader's backer Russia.\n\"The events in Syria have made the world realize once again, or at least they should have, that even the most cruel regime may fall and that Russia and its allies can be defeated,\" Tusk wrote online.\nEU and NATO member Poland has been a staunch backer of Ukraine, both before and after Tusk's coalition returned to power in October 2023. It's also a crucial logistics hub for military aid to its neighbor Ukraine.\nThe UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) war monitor said on Sunday that it had registered a total of 910 deaths since the start of the rebel operation in late November.\nThe SOHR said it had \"documented, since the launch of the ... [rebel] operation on November 27, 910 people killed.\"\nIt said this tally included 138 civilians, 380 Syrian troops and allied fighters, and 392 rebels.\nThe figure pointed to the minimal resistance attacking forces appear to have faced during their advance through Aleppo, Hama and Homs en route to Damascus, although the figure may also be incomplete.\nBy contrast, estimates vary, but most believe half a million or more have died during the entirety of Syria's civil war that began after anti-Assad protests in 2011.\nRussian media outlets including news agency Tass have reported, citing unnamed Kremlin sources, that Bashar Assad is in Moscow.\n\"Assad and members of his family arrived in Moscow. Russia, based on humanitarian considerations, granted them asylum,\" Tass quoted an unnamed Kremlin source as saying.\nA spokesman for Israel's IDF military urged residents of several Syrian towns in the demilitarized buffer zone of the Golan Heights near the de facto border to stay indoors.\n\"Urgent warning to the residents of southern Syria,\" Avichay Adraee wrote in a statement in Arabic, listing five Syrian towns in the buffer zone.\n\"The fighting inside your area is forcing the IDF to act and we do not intend to harm you. For your safety, you must stay at home and not go out until further notice,\" he wrote.\nDefense Minister Israel Katz had earlier said that IDF troops had seized a \"buffer zone and control points to ensure the protection of all Israeli communities in the Golan Heights — Jewish and Druze — so that they are not exposed to the threats from the other side.\"\nHe said the military took this step after Syrian troops abandoned their positions amid the regime collapse.\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said \"the cruel Assad dictatorship has collapsed\" in a response online, but also offered a note of caution.\n\"This historic change in the region offers opportunities but is not without risks,\" she said.\n\"Europe is ready to support safeguarding national unity and rebuilding a Syrian state that protects all minorities,\" she said.\nAssad is an Alawite, an offshoot of Shiite Islam, and not a member of the majority Sunni Muslim population in Syria. Around three-quarters of Syria's population are Sunnis, but the country has meaningful Shiite, Druze and Christian minority populations.\nHTS's leaders have pledged to ensure all minorities are respected under a new regime, but some observers have concerns about the offshoot of an al-Qaeda branch.\nVon der Leyen said that officials in Brussels were \"engaging with European and regional leaders and monitoring developments.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUkraine's Foreign Minister Andrii Sybiha focused on Russia's role, or rather its reduced role in Syria amid its invasion of Ukraine, when responding to Assad's fall.\n\"Assad has fallen,\" Sybiha said online. \"This is how it has always been and will always be for dictators who bet on [Russian President Vladimir] Putin. He always betrays those who rely on him.\"\nRussian backing, particularly from the skies, had contributed considerably to Assad's forces reclaiming control of the bulk of the war torn country in recent years.\nBut Russia's military footprint in Syria has reduced amid its invasion of Ukraine.\nUkraine's Sybiha called for all efforts to be made \"to stabilize the region and ensure inclusive political dialogue in Syria for the sake of effectively functioning state institutions.\"\n\"We express our readiness to pave the way to restoring relations in the future and reaffirm support for the Syrian people,\" he concluded.\nAssad's Syria had cut diplomatic ties with Ukraine in July 2022, a few months after the war with Russia began.\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer called for all sides to protect Syrian civilians and ensure aid can reach those in need after Assad's sudden fall.\n\"The developments in Syria in recent hours and days are unprecedented, and we are speaking to our partners in the region and monitoring the situation closely,\" Starmer said.\n\"The Syrian people have suffered under Assad's barbaric regime for too long and we welcome his departure. Our focus is now on ensuring a political solution prevails and stability is restored,\" he said.\nStarmer also joined several other world leaders in urging all sides to \"protect civilians and minorities,\" as well as ensuring that \"essential aid can reach the most vulnerable in the coming hours and days.\"\nThe head of the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) Islamist group, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, said that there is no room for turning back after the fall of Bashar Assad's regime.\n\"The future is ours and we are moving toward victory,\" al-Golani said in a statement read on Syrian state TV, after arriving in the capital Damascus.\nVideos shared on social media purportedly showed al-Golani kneeling down upon arriving in Damascus.\n\"We continue to work with determination to achieve the goals of our revolution... We are determined to complete the path we started in 2011,\" he said.\nSyria descended into civil war after a brutal government crackdown on the 2011 pro-democracy protests.\nWhile the war had been considered \"frozen\" for years, rebel groups made significant advances in a lightning offensive in recent days and then ousted Assad on Sunday.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nTurkish Foreign Minister Hakan Fidan said in a post on X, formerly Twitter, that Ankara would help ensure Syria's \"unity, integrity and security\" following Bashar Assad's ouster.\n\"Turkey is ready to take responsibility for all that is necessary to heal Syria's wounds and guarantee its unity, integrity and security,\" Fidan said.\n\"We will further intensify our work on this matter with countries in the region and with international actors in the coming days,\" he said.\nFidan said that he hoped millions of Syrians who were forced to flee the country would be able to return home. Turkey has taken in some 3.5 million Syrian refugees.\nIn earlier comments at a press conference in Doha, Qatar, Fidan called for Syria's opposition to remain united and warned against a \"desire for revenge.\"\nTurkey has launched several military incursions into northern Syria throughout the civil war in order to push back the Kurdish YPG militia, which Ankara considers to be a terrorist organization.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video"

Yes, NATO.\"\nShe warned Romania is now in \"a historical confrontation between preserving Romania's young democracy and those who want to return Romania to the Russian sphere of influence.\"\nThe position of Romanian President is largely ceremonial but the office does have semi-executive control over defense spending - a key issue for the increasingly important NATO member which shares a 650-kilometer (400-mile) border with Ukraine.\nRomanian Black Sea ports are also key for the export of Ukrainian grain, but Bucharest is under pressure to increase NATO spending while also battling to reduce a considerable fiscal deficit.\nCiolacu hoped to win over voters with his pledge of ensuring \"stability.\"\nCiolacu's government has thrown its support behind neighboring Ukraine following the Russian invasion, while Romania has taken on an increasingly important role within NATO.\nWhoever wins the second round will replace the current president, Klaus Iohannis, a liberal who has been a firm supporter of Ukraine. He has held the role since 2014.\nlo,kb,ss/ab (AP, Reuters)"

    "content": "At COP29, China is being urged to step up on climate finance. Could the country, which is expanding both renewables and coal power, enter a new era of climate leadership as the US leaves the stage?\nAs the COP29 climate summit in Baku enters crunch time, the spotlight has fallen on China.\nWith just a couple of days left for states to pull together a final agreement, there are hopes China will step in to fill a looming climate leadership void left by Donald Trump's reelection. The US president-elect has said he plans to pull back out of the Paris Agreement upon his return to the White House in January.\n\"I think it's certainly an important moment and a great opportunity for China to step into this leadership gap,\" said Yao Zhe, policy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia, noting the country's progress on decarbonizing at home and its capacity to scale up technology.\nAs the world's biggest carbon emitter and second-largest economy, negotiators are urging China to send a positive signal by setting more ambitious emissions cut targets — and to step up its responsibility on climate finance.\nA key aim of the summit this year is to come up with a funding goal — known as the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG) — to help support poorer countries cope with climate change.\nLeading economists have estimated that by the end of the decade, developing countries will need $1 trillion (€95 billion) a year to help them reduce emissions and deal with the impacts of extreme weather.\nIndustrialized countries responsible for most historical emissions that have caused planetary heating are supposed to contribute to the fund for developing countries. But delegates from the US, EU and some developing countries have said China should also contribute.\nThough a major economy, the UN still technically classes China as a developing country.\nDeveloping countries that are major emitters and have the capacity to commit to climate financing should do so, according to Rizwana Hasan, adviser to the Environment Ministry for Bangladesh's interim government. \"China can contribute, others can contribute, India can contribute to some extent,\" said Hasan.\nBut China's representatives at COP29 have said they will only continue to make voluntary commitments to climate finance. The country, which has not contributed to a previously agreed goal of developed countries to raise $100 billion annually, said it has provided around $24.5 billion in financing since 2016. It has also invested heavily in solar and wind power, and electric vehicles.\nOn the question of whether Beijing should be required to contribute to the NCQG, Adonia Ayebare, chair of the G77 coalition of developing countries and China group, told DW: \"They're chipping in already, no? They're part of the G77. They have the biggest solar panels in the world. They produce them and we buy them.\"\nNiklas Höhne, an expert in climate policy at the nonprofit think tank New Climate Institute, agrees that even if China is not officially mentioned as contributing to climate finance, in reality, they already do. \"They finance a lot of projects outside of their country. Right now, it's at least $3 billion a year,\" he said.\nRecognizing the contributions countries like China have already made could be a \"strong motivation to unblock discussions,\" said Celine Kauffmann, chief programs officer at IDDRI, an independent policy research institute focusing on sustainable development.\nAnother key reason for pressure on China to signal leadership and set new emissions targets is the pivotal role the country plays in global greenhouse gas emissions, said Höhne.\n\"China is so big. It's a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. So, if China peaks and declines, then also global greenhouse gas emissions peak and decline,\" he said.\nChina currently produces around twice as many emissions as the US, which is the second-largest polluter, and is responsible for 90% of global CO2 emissions growth since 2015.\nThe Paris Agreement calls on developed countries to take the lead in climate action due to their disproportionately large historical emissions. However, China's own historical emissions now surpass those of the EU, according to an analysis from UK-based climate science and policy platform Carbon Brief.\nYet China is also a global leader when it comes to investment and expansion of green power. In 2023, the country invested $273 billion in clean energy, followed by Europe, which spent around half that.\nChina's investments in renewables accounted for a third of all those worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, which says China also commissioned as much solar PV in 2023 as the entire world in 2022 and that its wind capacity grew by 66% last year. Almost 60% of new electric car registrations are in China.\nIn September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country aimed to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\nBut according to a Climate Change Performance Index published on Wednesday, China ranked 55 out of 67 countries monitored for progress on climate action.\nThe index noted that despite being a renewables powerhouse and on the cusp of peaking emissions, it lacks sufficient climate targets and remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Coal provides most of the country's energy, and production hit a record high in 2023, according to the IEA.\nTo keep global heating under the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold (2.7 Fahrenheit), the world needs to drastically cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Niklas Höhne.\n\"That's why everybody's hoping that China can propose a target on a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and they can, because renewables are really expanding very, very fast in China,\" he added.\nTim Schauenberg contributed to this report from the COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nCorrection, November 21, 2024: A previous version of this article misattributed a quote to the former environment minister of Bangladesh. This has now been corrected. That version also incorrectly stated that Rizwana Hasan is Bangladesh's environment minister. She is an adviser to the Environment Ministry for Bangladesh's interim government.\nEdited by: Jennifer Collins\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video"

Tens of thousands of protesters continued their calls for Yoon to resign.\nThis live blog has now closed.\nThough South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol survived an impeachment vote in parliament on Saturday over his ill-fated decision to declare martial law this week, Han Dong-hoon, the leader of his own People Power Party (PPP), said the president will eventually step down.\nThe PPP boycotted Saturday's impeachment vote — put forward by the main opposition Democratic Party (DP) — scuttling the movement and keeping Yoon from being impeached.\nAfter the vote, PPP leader Han said the party had decided that Yoon would resign and had \"effectively obtained\" his promise to do so.\nHan emphasized that Yoon was no longer in a position to carry out his public duties and his resignation was unavoidable.\nThough he pledged the PPP would \"resolve this crisis in a more orderly and responsible manner\" than impeachment would have, Han refused to say just when Yoon would step down.\nSouth Korea's constitution requires a presidential election be held within 60 days of a presidential vacancy.\nYoon's term in office runs out in May 2027.\n\"The People Power Party will pursue an orderly departure of the president in order to minimize confusion for the people,\" said Han, who added that Yoon would be \"effectively excluded from his duties, and the prime minister will consult with the party to manage state affairs.\"\nThe opposition DP ridiculed that idea as \"absurd and illegal.\"\n\"Neither the people, nor the law, nor anyone has given Han the power to remove [Yoon] from office,\" the party said in a statement, saying impeachment is the only way.\nSouth Korea's main opposition party promised to renew its attempts to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol as early as Wednesday after a motion failed due to a walkout by ruling PPP lawmakers.\n\"I will impeach Yoon Suk Yeol, who has become the worst risk for South Korea, at any cost,\" said Lee Jae-myung, who heads the Democratic Party.\nOpposition parties hold 192 seats in the National Assembly. The impeachment motion required 200 votes to pass, but only three PPP lawmakers participated in the vote amid a ruling party boycott.\nA motion to impeach South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol failed after most ruling PPP party lawmakers walked out from the vote.\nThe motion was dropped without ballots being counted as the total votes did not reach 200, or the two-thirds majority required for it to pass.\nOpposition parties, which hold 192 seats in parliament, presented the bill after Yoon briefly declared martial law last week.\nOnly three PPP lawmakers participated in the vote.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nProtesters in South Korea expressed frustration over the likely defeat of a motion to impeach President Yoon Suk Yeol due to a boycott by most ruling party lawmakers.\nNearly 150,000 people demonstrated around the National Assembly, according to police.\nGasps of disappointment were already heard from the crowd after a bill to launch an investigation into first lady Kim Keon Hee was defeated.\n\"I feel terrible that it has come to this today,\" protester An Jun-cheol told the AFP news agency. \"What the ruling party lawmakers did today — walking away from the vote — is nothing more than an attempt to cement their power and status, with no regard for the people.\"\nThe Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) also condemned Yoon's attempt to impose martial law last week, according to South Korean daily The Korean Times.\n\"Today, right here, we will mark the end of Yoon Suk Yeol,\" KCTU leader Yang Kyung-soo said while speaking to a crowd in front of the National Assembly. \"Let us ultimately punish him with even more powerful protests.\"\nOpposition parties said they could propose another bill if the Saturday impeachment vote fails.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nShin Dong-uk, a lawmaker of the ruling PPP, said that the party never prevented its lawmakers from voting in an impeachment hearing against President Yoon Suk Yeol, according to Reuters news agency.\nMost PPP lawmakers walked out of the hearing, with only one remaining in his seat.

    "content": "At COP29, China is being urged to step up on climate finance. Could the country, which is expanding both renewables and coal power, enter a new era of climate leadership as the US leaves the stage?\nAs the COP29 climate summit in Baku enters crunch time, the spotlight has fallen on China.\nWith just a couple of days left for states to pull together a final agreement, there are hopes China will step in to fill a looming climate leadership void left by Donald Trump's reelection. The US president-elect has said he plans to pull back out of the Paris Agreement upon his return to the White House in January.\n\"I think it's certainly an important moment and a great opportunity for China to step into this leadership gap,\" said Yao Zhe, policy analyst at Greenpeace East Asia, noting the country's progress on decarbonizing at home and its capacity to scale up technology.\nAs the world's biggest carbon emitter and second-largest economy, negotiators are urging China to send a positive signal by setting more ambitious emissions cut targets — and to step up its responsibility on climate finance.\nA key aim of the summit this year is to come up with a funding goal — known as the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance (NCQG) — to help support poorer countries cope with climate change.\nLeading economists have estimated that by the end of the decade, developing countries will need $1 trillion (€95 billion) a year to help them reduce emissions and deal with the impacts of extreme weather.\nIndustrialized countries responsible for most historical emissions that have caused planetary heating are supposed to contribute to the fund for developing countries. But delegates from the US, EU and some developing countries have said China should also contribute.\nThough a major economy, the UN still technically classes China as a developing country.\nDeveloping countries that are major emitters and have the capacity to commit to climate financing should do so, according to Rizwana Hasan, adviser to the Environment Ministry for Bangladesh's interim government. \"China can contribute, others can contribute, India can contribute to some extent,\" said Hasan.\nBut China's representatives at COP29 have said they will only continue to make voluntary commitments to climate finance. The country, which has not contributed to a previously agreed goal of developed countries to raise $100 billion annually, said it has provided around $24.5 billion in financing since 2016. It has also invested heavily in solar and wind power, and electric vehicles.\nOn the question of whether Beijing should be required to contribute to the NCQG, Adonia Ayebare, chair of the G77 coalition of developing countries and China group, told DW: \"They're chipping in already, no? They're part of the G77. They have the biggest solar panels in the world. They produce them and we buy them.\"\nNiklas Höhne, an expert in climate policy at the nonprofit think tank New Climate Institute, agrees that even if China is not officially mentioned as contributing to climate finance, in reality, they already do. \"They finance a lot of projects outside of their country. Right now, it's at least $3 billion a year,\" he said.\nRecognizing the contributions countries like China have already made could be a \"strong motivation to unblock discussions,\" said Celine Kauffmann, chief programs officer at IDDRI, an independent policy research institute focusing on sustainable development.\nAnother key reason for pressure on China to signal leadership and set new emissions targets is the pivotal role the country plays in global greenhouse gas emissions, said Höhne.\n\"China is so big. It's a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions. So, if China peaks and declines, then also global greenhouse gas emissions peak and decline,\" he said.\nChina currently produces around twice as many emissions as the US, which is the second-largest polluter, and is responsible for 90% of global CO2 emissions growth since 2015.\nThe Paris Agreement calls on developed countries to take the lead in climate action due to their disproportionately large historical emissions. However, China's own historical emissions now surpass those of the EU, according to an analysis from UK-based climate science and policy platform Carbon Brief.\nYet China is also a global leader when it comes to investment and expansion of green power. In 2023, the country invested $273 billion in clean energy, followed by Europe, which spent around half that.\nChina's investments in renewables accounted for a third of all those worldwide, according to the International Energy Agency, which says China also commissioned as much solar PV in 2023 as the entire world in 2022 and that its wind capacity grew by 66% last year. Almost 60% of new electric car registrations are in China.\nIn September 2020, Chinese President Xi Jinping said the country aimed to peak carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.\nBut according to a Climate Change Performance Index published on Wednesday, China ranked 55 out of 67 countries monitored for progress on climate action.\nThe index noted that despite being a renewables powerhouse and on the cusp of peaking emissions, it lacks sufficient climate targets and remains heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Coal provides most of the country's energy, and production hit a record high in 2023, according to the IEA.\nTo keep global heating under the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold (2.7 Fahrenheit), the world needs to drastically cut global greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, said Niklas Höhne.\n\"That's why everybody's hoping that China can propose a target on a significant reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and they can, because renewables are really expanding very, very fast in China,\" he added.\nTim Schauenberg contributed to this report from the COP29 climate summit in Baku, Azerbaijan.\nCorrection, November 21, 2024: A previous version of this article misattributed a quote to the former environment minister of Bangladesh. This has now been corrected. That version also incorrectly stated that Rizwana Hasan is Bangladesh's environment minister. She is an adviser to the Environment Ministry for Bangladesh's interim government.\nEdited by: Jennifer Collins\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video"

The government says it will not help 'criminals.'\nFor nearly two weeks, South African police have closely monitored an abandoned gold mine at Stilfontein, about 150 kilometers (100 miles) southwest of Johannesburg. The mine reportedly descends vertically for more than 2 km (1.2 miles) underground and a rope is the only way down or up.\nIt is believed that hundreds of illegal  are facing a grim situation after police cut off their supply lines in a bid to force them out.\nThe security officers have also prevented the locals from sending food and water down to the miners.\nIllegal mining is widespread in South Africa where the miners are known as \"zama zama\", which in isiZulu loosely translates to \"those who take a chance.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nPolice have arrested more than 1,000 of the miners who resurfaced at Stillfontein recently.\n\"There's nothing left for someone to eat, to drink or anything that can make a human being survive,\" Ayanda Ndabeni, one of the miners who came out of the abandoned mine on Friday, told AFP. Police first detained him, but later, he was released as he is a South African national with no previous criminal record.\nHe said the police operation known as \"Vala Umgodi,\" or \"Close the Hole,\" had brought immense suffering for those still underground.\n\"Some of us, they died. Some of us are sick, critical.\" Ndabeni said.\nLast week, a decomposed body was brought out, raising fears that there could be more Many of the miners are undocumented migrants other parts of southern Africa.\nThe South African government caused a stir last week when a senior official told reporters that it would not be sending help to the illegal miners at Stillfontein.\n\"Honestly, we're not sending help to criminals, we're going to smoke them out,\" Minister in the Presidency, Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, said.\nIn response, some community members who sympathized with the miners held placards that read \"Smoke ANC out,\" referring to President Cyril Ramaphosa's African National Congress party.\nSouth Africa has been plagued by illegal mining for decades. The informal sector is run through small-time pilfering and organized criminal networks. In 2022, the government set up a task force to fight the trade countrywide.\nAs the standoff continued, the families of the miners trapped at Stillfontein braced for the worst. \"If the government says it can't assist them, we don't know what to do,\" Zuziwe Ndabeni, who has relatives in the mine, told DW. \"I have been here at the mine from 5 a.m. until now, and it's 5 p.m. We are getting no answers from authorities. We are waiting. I don't know until when.\"\n\"Linah Minezeya, a Zimbabwean woman with two sons inside the abandoned mine, told DW: \"I'm here because I want to see my children. I haven't received any calls from them since February. I'm worried because they have no food inside there. I want to know if they are still alive or if they are dead. Some are telling us that there are no people inside, so I don't know if my sons are alive or dead.\"\nJohannes Qankase, a community leader in Stilfontein, urged the government to reconsider its position. \"We are saying to our government, let's give these people food. Let's give them water so that they regain their strength for us to start the program of removing them, or let's give them a grace period,\" Qankase told DW.\n\"For example, we say we are going to give you six months. We get somebody like we did before to get down the mine to give them letters stating they have only six months to be out of the mine.\"\nHowever, South Africa's National Police Spokesperson, Athlenda Mathe, dismissed the pleas to assist the miners. \"There is no standoff here. We are enforcing the law,\" Mathe told DW, citing Section 205 of the country's constitution, which gives the police the mandate to prevent and combat criminality.\n\"That is exactly what we are doing. We are requesting communities and South Africans to rally behind the work that we are doing.\" He said what the police were doing was the best strategy law enforcement could devise. \"Resurface in a safe and secure manner and you will be processed accordingly,\"  Mathe said.\nEdited by: Benita van Eyssen"

DW takes a closer look.\nOne of the most popular chants in Syria at the moment and among Syrians of the diaspora translates as \"One, one, one, the Syrian people are one.\" As people come to terms with the collapse of Bashar Assad's regime, there are hopes that peace and stability are coming to the divided country.\nIt is impossible to get accurate and current data on Syria's varied population. This is due to a war that lasted over a decade and that observers believe may have ended with the recent toppling of the long-time dictator Assad after an offensive by the Islamist militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS).\nThose numbers there are differ wildly according to the source. Syria's Central Bureau of Statistics  said 29.2 million people lived in the country as of December 10, 2019. The World Factbook produced by the CIA, the US' foreign intelligence service, then estimates that by July 2021 around 20.4 million people were living in Syria. For its part, the World Bank put the population at around 23 million in 2023. Other estimates pin the number closer to 25 million.\nWhile it is safe to assume that the true measure of Syria's overall population lies somewhere in between, the huge differences also highlight the impact of the devastating civil war that has left the country hugely fractured.\nThe United Nations (UN) estimates that the war has caused around 600,000 deaths. It says that 6 million Syrians fled the country and close to 7 million found themselves internally displaced.\nDespite the lack of reliable demographic data, estimates on religious and ethnic minorities in Syria seem to be widely comparable.\nSyria's population consists of some 70% Sunni Muslims who live all across the country.\nThey believe that the founder of Islam, Prophet Muhammad, did not explicitly declare a successor.\nShia Muslims, who make up 13% of Syria's population, believe that Muhammad designated his cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Abi Talib as his successor and the first in a line of hereditary imams.\nThe majority of Syria's Shia Muslims, including deposed leader Bashar Assad, are Alawites, a minority esoteric sect of Islam.\nMany of this minority live in Syria's western coastal region, particularly in the cities of Homs and Hama.\nApart from different Muslim groups, Syria is also home to religious minorities such as Christians, whose denominations include Greek Orthodox, Syriac Orthodox, Maronite, Syrian Catholic, Roman Catholic and Greek Catholic.\nThere are also many ethnic minorities in Syria, including Druze, Palestinian, Iraqi, Armenian, Greek, Assyrian, Circassian, Mandean and Turkoman groups. Most of them live in and around Damascus.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Kurdish-ruled Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria, also known as Rojava, is home to Syria's largest minority, about 2.5 million Kurdish people. Some Kurds also live in and around Syria's capital Damascus.\nA minority among the Kurds are the Yazidis, who mainly live in the Aleppo governorate.\nSyria also hosts 12 refugee camps where 438,000 Palestinian refugees currently live, according to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA).\nA sizable chunk of Syria's Sunni Muslims live in Syria's northeastern Idlib region, which in the past five years became the last opposition stronghold of the war-torn country. Run by HTS, it became the temporary home of some 4 million displaced Sunnis, Christians and Druze.\nThey will be looking to return to their original villages and towns as HTS establishes its rule across the country.\nEdited by: Anne Thomas\n"

    "content": "These bacteria have evolved the ability to resist treatment with antibiotics, and it's making them more deadly and harder to treat.\nMillions of people die as a direct result of bacterial infections — especially when the bacteria have developed a resistance to the antibiotics we use to treat them. It's this drug resistance that makes them particularly deadly.\nAnd the latest data is not encouraging. The emergence of several drug-resistant bacteria species is proving a serious problem for health systems around the world, especially for low-and-middle income countries.\nIt's estimated that bacterial antimicrobial resistance was directly responsible for 1.27 million global deaths in 2019, and could be associated with as many as 4.95 million deaths, according to the the World Health Organization (WHO).\nPriority drug-resistant bacteria which can cause serious illness include mycobacterium tuberculosis, the bacteria that causes tuberculosis, and high-burden resistant pathogens such as Salmonella, Shigella, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus.\nIn this article, we'll focus on antibiotic resistance. But more broadly, you may have heard the term antimicrobial resistance (AMR).\nAMR refers to all kinds of microbes — tiny living things, or organisms — including bacteria but also parasites, viruses and fungi, which have adapted to resist common medical treatments.\nPut simply: the drugs don't work as well as they used to, and we're struggling to find new ones to treat illnesses. Even common ones like urinary tract infections (UTIs) can turn fatal when left untreated.\nThe WHO monitors and ranks bacteria according to various data:\nThe bacteria get a score for each metric and then get ranked. The 2024 list features two dozen priority pathogens. Here are the top eight.\n1. Klebsiella pneumoniae\nKlebsiella is a type of bacteria found in the intestines and human feces. Klebsiella pneumoniae can cause pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound or surgical site infections and meningitis if it gets into the nervous system.\nKlebsiella pneumoniae can become a so-called \"superbug\" in hospitals, spreading fast and becoming resistant to most available drug treatments.\nIt is specifically resistant to carbapenem, an \"antibiotic of last resort\" — it's used when all other treatments for multidrug-resistant pathogens have failed. Klebsiella pneumoniae is also resistant to a third-generation antibiotic called cephalosporin.\n2. Escherichia coli (E. coli)\nAs with klebsiella bacteria, Escherichia coli (E. coli) bacteria are usually found in the intestines of human and non-human animals. They are also found in the environment, food and water.\nMost kinds of E. coli are harmless, but some can cause illnesses, including diarrhea, urinary tract infections, pneumonia and sepsis. E.Coli concentrations in Paris' Seine River came under scrutiny during the 2024 Summer Olympics in France.\nE. coli is resistant to third-generation cephalosporin — a commonly prescribed antibiotic, which is also used to treat sexually transmitted infections, such as gonorrhea. E. coli is also resistant to carbapenem.\n3. Acinetobacter baumannii\nBack in 2012, researchers described Acinetobacter baumannii as an \"emerging opportunistic bacterial pathogen\" associated with hospital-acquired infections (HAIs).\nLong-term hospital patients with a compromised immune system, or those in hospital for more than 90 days, were identified as having a high risk of contracting an infection. Acinetobacter baumannii is carbapenem-resistant.\n4. Mycobacterium tuberculosis\nMycobacterium tuberculosis (TB) causes tuberculosis, a potentially fatal, bacterial infection of the lungs.\nTB killed 1.25 million people, including 161,000 people with HIV, in 2023.\nThe WHO said \"TB has probably returned to being the world's leading cause of death from a single infectious agent, following three years in which it was replaced by coronavirus disease (COVID-19).\"\nMycobacterium tuberculosis is resistant to rifampicin — an antibiotic used to treat mycobacterial infections, like TB and leprosy, or M. leprae.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n5. Salmonella Typhi\nSalmonella Typhi causes typhoid fever, a life-threatening illness. It mostly affects people living in regions with poor sanitation and unsafe water and food sources — such as parts of Asia, Africa and Latin America.\nThe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates there are about 9 million cases of typhoid worldwide every year. Salmonella Typhi is resistant to flouroquinolone — a broad-spectrum antibiotic, with a range of side effects, which have led the European Medicines Agency to restrict its use.\n6. Shigella species\nThere are four species of Shigella: Shigella sonnei, Shigella flexneri, Shigella boydii, Shigella dysenteriae. Shigella bacteria cause diarrhea, stomach pain and fever.\nThey spread via contaminated food and water, but also during sexual activity with a sick person. They are fluoroquinolone-resistant.\nShigella species that are resistant to almost all antimicrobial classes are increasing in prevalence and becoming globally dominant. The greatest burden of disease is in low- and middle-income countries with poor sanitation.\n7. Enterococcus faecium\nEnterococcus faecium lives in the gut flora, also known as microbiome. It can lead to serious illness for people with diabetes or a chronic kidney condition.\nEnterococcus, can cause infections such as UTIs and infections of the nervous system, if it enters parts of the body outside the gut.\nEnterococcus are resistant to vancomycin — an antibiotic, which is also used to treat infections caused by staphylococci bacteria, which is also drug-resistant.\n8. Pseudomonas aeruginosa\nPseudomonas aeruginosa leads to infections in the blood, lungs, urinary tract and other parts of the body, often after surgery in hospitals. Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteria are multidrug-resistant (MDR), including the common antibiotic, carbapenems.\nPseudomonas aeruginosa infections carry specific risks in immunocompromised patients. Despite being moved from \"critical\" to \"high\" priority, it remains a significant concern due to its drug resistance profile.\nEdited by: Fred Schwaller\nSelect sources:\n2024 WHO Bacterial Priority Pathogens List (WHO BPPL), World Health Organization https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240093461\nGlobal burden of bacterial antimicrobial resistance 1990-2021: a systematic analysis with forecasts to 2050.

Like many nations with relatively low per capita carbon emissions, the Caribbean archipelago is being swamped by the rising seas and extreme storms that much bigger greenhouse gas emitters helped create.\nGaston Browne, prime minister of Antigua and Barbuda, told the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on Monday that sea level rise driven by \"unchecked emissions\" has eroded island coastlines and is \"swallowing land that is vital to our country.\"\nHe is one of nearly 100 nation representatives stating their climate case to the ICJ in The Hague.\nThe hope is that failures to cut planet-heating fossil fuel emissions in line with the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit temperatures rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit), will be declared a violation of international law.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn 2023 the United Nations, led by the Pacific island state of Vanuatu, specifically requested that the ICJ adjudicate on climate responsibility, having expressed \"profound alarm that emissions of greenhouse gases continue to rise\" despite ambitious climate targets.\nThough any advisory opinion issued by the ICJ will not be binding, experts have said the court's stance on a state's obligation to act on climate change could set an important precedent for further litigation cases against polluters.\nBrowne also told the court that Barbuda was mostly destroyed by Hurricane Irma in 2017. \"Barbuda clearly did not stand a chance,\" he said of the massive storm that forced most of the island's inhabitants to evacuate to Antigua.\nAlmost 50% of houses on Barbuda were left uninhabitable after Irma and a second powerful hurricane hit in as many weeks. And the island is still burdened with huge debt from tropical cyclones made stronger due to rising ocean temperatures, according to climate scientists.\n\"We come to you because existing action has not adequately addressed the crisis that is devastating our lives and our future,\" Browne told the ICJ, at a time when fossil fuel emissions are again rising as climate action stagnates.\nRalph Regenvanu, the special envoy for climate change and the environment from Vanuatu, opened the proceeding on Monday by stating that continued emissions expansion was \"unlawful\" and \"must cease.\"\n\"We find ourselves on the front lines of a crisis we did not create, a crisis that threatens our very existence,\" he said of Vanuatu, a nation facing worsening climate-fueled storms and sea level rise.\nYouth climate activist Cynthia Houniuhi from the Solomon Islands in the Pacific told the ICJ judges that major polluting nations need to be held accountable \"to help us course-correct and renew hope in humanity's ability to address the greatest challenge of our time.\"\nThe tropical archipelago is one of the world's most climate vulnerable, where floods, cyclones and even droughts are becoming more extreme.\nDespite calls to articulate a legal opinion that confirms a state's duty to act on climate change, large fossil fuel-producing nations such as the United States have questioned the court's jurisdiction.\nMargaret L. Taylor, legal adviser at the US State Department, said any \"legal obligations relating to climate change mitigation\" that is identified by the court should come through existing UN climate treaties, primarily the 2015 Paris Agreement.\nSpeaking at The Hague, Taylor said the United States — the world's largest historic emitter of greenhouse gases — wanted the court to only judge in a way that \"preserves and promotes the centrality\" of existing treaties.\nThe United Nations had requested that the ICJ outline any legal consequences for states that damage the climate. But the US played down the court's authority to, for example, enforce climate compensation claims on large emitters.\nTaylor said the ICJ should not weigh whether countries have \"violated obligations\" in the past regarding climate policy. \"Nor would it be appropriate,\" she said, for the court to decide whether states have a \"responsibility for reparations.\"\nVishal Prasad, director of the Pacific Islands Students Fighting Climate Change, said the United States was seeking to \"evade its responsibilities as one of the world's largest polluters,\" and had a \"blatant disregard for the pressing urgency of the climate crisis.\"\n\"The US is content with its business-as-usual approach and has taken every possible measure to shirk its historical responsibility, disregard human rights, and reject climate justice,\" he said.\nOn the first day of hearings, Saudi Arabia, like the United States, urged the court to be cautious in its legal opinion, arguing that UN treaties on climate change already provided a comprehensive blueprint for state climate action.\nChina, the biggest global greenhouse gas emitter, insisted that existing UN climate negotiations should remain the \"primary channel\" to govern action, a position also backed by fossil fuel powerhouse Australia.\nRalph Regenvanu of Vanuatu expressed disappointment at efforts to limit the ICJ's jurisdiction on climate under the guise of maintaining current accords.\n\"These treaties are essential, but they cannot be a veil for inaction or a substitute for legal accountability,\" the special envoy said. \"There needs to be an accounting for the failure to curb emissions and the climate change impacts.\"\nEdited by: Tamsin Walker"

    "content": "The so-called \"Islamic State\" terror group has been considerably weakened in Syria, but not completely destroyed. Still operating in some parts of the country, some fear IS could endanger a peaceful transition.\nThe \"Islamic State\" (IS) , also known as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), has been widely defeated across Syria, but still poses a threat to the nation's peaceful future. This, at least, is the estimation of outgoing US President Joe Biden, whose administration has ordered massive airstrikes against the extremist organization.\nThe arsenal of military aircraft involved in the campaign is a sign of just how seriously the Biden administration takes the threat. Heavy B-52 bombers have been involved in strikes on central parts of Syria, as were F-15 and A-10 Thunderbolt fighter jets.\nOn social media platform X, formerly Twitter, the US Central Command said these \"strikes against the ISIS leaders, operatives, and camps\" in central Syria were \"part of the ongoing mission to disrupt, degrade, and defeat ISIS.\" It reported that it had conducted \"dozens of precision airstrikes.\"\n\"There should be no doubt — we will not allow ISIS to reconstitute and take advantage of the current situation in Syria,\" General Michael Erik Kurilla was quoted as saying. \"All organizations in Syria should know that we will hold them accountable if them partner with or support ISIS in any way.\"\n\"We will help […] ensure stability in eastern Syria, protecting any personnel — our personnel against any threats,\" Biden said in a statement on Sunday. \"Our mission against ISIS will be maintained, including the security of detention facilities where ISIS fighters are being held as prisoners.\"\nMiddle East expert and political consultant Carsten Wieland said the so-called \"Islamic State\" never truly left Syria, even if it had been widely defeated.\n\"There are still various cells, including sleeper cells, in central and eastern Syria,\" he told DW. \"And they certainly do pose a threat.\" That is particularly serious when there's a power vacuum, he said, adding that he thought the US had made the right decision.\n\"Now's the time to stabilize the forces that have taken over power in Syria as peacefully as possible, and not to burden them with another front in the form of the 'Islamic State.'\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFounded in Iraq in the context of the 2003 US invasion, the \"Islamic State\" started spreading through Syria in 2012 amid the chaos of civil war. Here, the organization called itself the Al-Nusra Front. Its commander, Abu Mohammed al-Golani, is the same man who now leads the Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) militia that just overthrew Syrian dictator Bashar  Assad.\nFrom an ideological standpoint, al-Golani had increasingly distanced himself from the Iraqi IS, and the rivalry between the two groups mounted in the subsequent years.\nWeakened by years of civil war, the Syrian armed forces did not have much left to counter the IS. Many soldiers lost their lives in battles and ambushes.\nBut from 2015, IS — just like the Al-Nusra Front — faced growing pressure from the US military. Their ranks were considerably weakened and they were forced to concede their claims to any territory in 2019. While several military and spiritual IS commanders, known as caliphs, managed to stay in power, the US was repeatedly successful in disabling cells.\nMany IS members were imprisoned in northern Syria, where they remain in camps to this day.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nDespite all this, several IS cells and camps stayed intact, especially in the Badia desert, along Syria's border with Iraq. Wieland said the cells often carried out attacks on the rural population, especially against those hunting for truffles in the area.\n\"Several dozen people have been killed,\" he said. Since other members act as sleeper cells and wait for possible orders, it's almost impossible to definitively destroy the group, he explained.\nIn its current state, IS seems unable to spread very far, let alone reestablish control in its former territory. But following the toppling of Assad and the political upheaval, the notoriously brutal terror group might attempt to expand its sphere of influence again. This is why it's currently under such fierce attack.\nCommenting on al-Golani's ties with IS, Wieland said it was quite conceivable that the HTS leader had indeed broken with its ideology. \"The group reached various deals and agreements with local actors,\" he said. \"That gives me hope for a constructive progression.\"\nHe also pointed out that he found it \"remarkable that there have been no large massacres or revenge campaigns.\"\n\"Under the IS ideology, the past few days would have seen entirely different developments.\"\nThis article was originally written in German.\nCorrection, December 11, 2024: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of Abu Mohammed al-Golani.

    "content": "Italian composer Giacomo Puccini was the pop star of his era. Even 100 years after his death, his operas like 'Tosca,' 'Madama Butterfly' and 'La Boheme' remain staple repertoire — and politically relevant today.\nThe world of opera was shaken on the morning of November 29, 1924.\nGiacomo Puccini, the most famous composer of his time, had died in Brussels as a result of surgery for throat cancer. Or rather, as a result of post-operative treatment.\nThe 66-year-old chain smoker's heart turned out to be too weak for radiation therapy — a technology that was still in its infancy 100 years ago.\nPuccini composed ten operas during his four decades of creative work.\nAt least seven of them are among the most popular of all time, including \"Manon Lescaut,\" \"La Boheme,\" \"Tosca,\" \"Madame Butterfly,\" \"La fanciulla del West,\" \"Il Trittico\" — and of course his last and, for many, greatest masterpiece, \"Turandot.\"\nThese days, Puccini operas are staged more than two thousand times a year worldwide, regardless of any wars or crises. This puts the great Italian far ahead of his colleagues Rossini and Wagner.\nOnly works by Verdi and Mozart are staged more often, but they left behind 28 and 21 operas respectively, making Puccini, with his astonishingly short oeuvre, the absolute leader in the industry in purely mathematical terms.\n\"I've always wondered why Puccini is so successful,\" says German musicologist Arnold Jacobshagen, whose biography of Puccini has just been published.\n\"I always suspected that the reasons for his success lay in the quality of the music, and the more I looked into it, the more I realized that it was indeed down to the quality of the music and not the bad taste of the audience, as many malicious tongues have long claimed,\" he tells DW.\nPuccini had his breakthrough in 1893 with his third opera, \"Manon Lescaut,\" and he soon became one of the most successful and richest artists of his time.\nThree main characteristics of Puccini's working style can be identified as the reasons for his immense success. For one thing, the composer was an extreme perfectionist, a master of \"tightening and moderation,\" according to Jacobshagen.\nOr, as the composer himself once aptly put it: \"A good musician must be able to do everything, but not give everything.\" Conductors, singers and, above all, grateful orchestral musicians still admire the technological precision of his scores to this day.\nIn addition, the Italian had an incredible flair for the theatrical. \"Alongside William Shakespeare, Giuseppe Verdi and Henrik Ibsen, Puccini is the most frequently performed tragedian in the world,\" says Jacobshagen.\nIn close collaboration with his meticulously selected librettists and publisher Giulio Ricordi, the driving force behind the Puccini brand, the composer created ever-new intertwinings of love, suffering and death with each of his operas.\nThirdly, Puccini's music has a unique ability to speak to the listener in a dramatic and immediate way. As music historian Julian Budden notes: \"No composer communicated as directly with his audience as Puccini.\"\nComparisons are often drawn between Puccini and Johann Sebastian Bach.\nLike the great German composer, the Italian opera genius also came from a respected dynasty of church musicians. From the early 18th century onwards, the Puccinis shaped the cultural life of Lucca in Tuscany.\nThe impressive line of Puccini's composing ancestors begins with Jacopo Puccini, born in 1712, who was the organist of the cathedral and maestro di cappella in the Republic of Lucca.\nJacopo married a singer, the beautiful Angela Piccinini. Their son Antonio and then grandson Michele were the city's maestri di cappella for the next hundred years.\nGreat-grandson Giacomo, the future opera genius born in Lucca in 1858, also grew up among musicians and was employed as an organist at the age of fourteen.\nThanks to his roots in the musical world, he enjoyed the best possible education and found his way into the arts very early on, although this led him past church music and into opera.\nMusicologist Jacobshagen considers the obvious comparison with Bach to be ideologically charged.\n\"The authors who first drew this parallel did so during the period of Italian fascism and German Nazism,\" he says.\nThe aim was to promote a cultural connection between Italy and Germany, and \"Puccini was an ideal candidate to be associated with one of the great heroes of Germany's musical past.\"\nPuccini, like many representatives of the Italian elite of his time, had a certain sympathy for the emerging fascist movement and saw Mussolini as a politician who would \"finally bring order.\"\nThere was also a personal meeting between the composer and Il Duce, on Puccini's initiative.\n\"So perhaps it was a stroke of luck that the composer died of this terrible cancer in 1924,\" Jacobshagen tells DW. \"Because otherwise, given his prominence, there would certainly have been a lot of photos in the world showing him with Mussolini.\"\nThat would have been enough to discredit the generally apolitical composer in the long term.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nFragile, but strong and determined — these are the Puccini heroines that the world admires: Cio-Cio-San, Tosca, Mimi. Anyone who created such poignant female characters certainly understood women. But he was also a great tormentor of women.\n\"Puccini was certainly an attractive man,\" says Jacobshagen.\nYou only have to look at some of the portraits of the composer to agree: the well-dressed Tuscan comes across as noble and graceful.\nAustrian composer Alma Mahler-Werfel even thought that Puccini was \"one of the most beautiful people\" she had ever seen, a Don Juan, like an \"English gentleman with romantic blood.\" Alma, a coveted beauty herself, knew what she was talking about.\nCompleting his dashing image, the composer was a passionate hunter and a technophile. He indulged his passion with ever-new purchases of cars, motorboats and other wonders of progress, such as an irrigation system for the garden of his villa in Torre del Lago.\nThe handsome musical genius with strong sex appeal led an intense and varied love life, without much consideration for those around him.\nOnly after twenty years of living together and at the insistence of his family did he marry his \"main love,\" Elvira Gemignani, mother of his only son, Antonio. Numerous affairs and infidelities overshadowed this relationship before the marriage — and even more so afterward.\n\"For too long, you made me your victim, you trampled on my good and loving feelings for you by always insulting my feelings as a mother and passionate lover,\" Elvira wrote to her husband.\nTheir failed love had a tragic climax: raging with jealousy, Elvira pursued a maid, Doria Manfredi, and drove the 23-year-old to suicide. Elvira Puccini was found guilty of denunciation and defamation of character in a trial and was bailed out by her husband.\nPuccini's \"relationship to the themes of family and partnership proves to be somewhat complex,\" is his biographer's understated assessment.\n\"Ma il mio mistero è chiuso in me — But my secret is locked inside me,\" sings Calaf in the famous aria \"Nessun dorma.\" In the end, Puccini's secret also remains locked inside him.\nProof of the greatness of his art, however, is its relevance beyond the opera stage. Arnold Jacobshagen considers \"Madama Butterfly\" to be an \"outcry against sexual exploitation and colonialism.\"\n\"Tosca\" and even more so \"Turandot\" should also be understood as pleas against tyranny and arbitrary rule and are more relevant than ever today, in the age of Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin.\nPuccini's mastery of getting to the heart of the matter therefore also has a political dimension, and a timeless one.\nThis article was originally written in German."

President Emmanuel Macron said he would name a new prime minister in the coming days.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron addressed the nation on Thursday, hours after Prime Minister Michel Barnier handed in his resignation following Wednesday's vote of no-confidence.\nMacron rejected calls from the opposition to follow Barnier in stepping down, saying he would remain in office until the next presidential election in 2027.\nHe vowed to \"appoint a prime minister in the coming days\" saying that this person would be tasked with forming a \"government of general interest\" in order to pass a budget.\nThe president also accused the left-wing and far-right parties that voted to topple the prime minister of being an \"anti-republican front.\"\n\"They are not thinking about your lives, let's be honest. They are thinking of just one thing: the presidential election,\" he said during his televised address.\nBarnier met with Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday to submit his resignation, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history.\n\"The prime minister today submitted the resignation of his government\" to Macron, who has \"taken note\" of the resignation, the Elysee said.\nBarnier and his ministers remain \"in charge of daily business until the appointment of a new government,\" it added.\nThe premier stepped down after lawmakers voted to oust his minority government in a no-confidence motion on Wednesday.\nThe move came after Barnier forced through an unpopular budget bill in an attempt to cut France's high fiscal deficit.\nThe plan contained tax increases and spending cuts worth €60 billion ($63.1 billion), aimed at bringing the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025 from an estimated 6.1% this year. The aim is to trim the deficit down to 3% by 2029.\nIt was seen as an attempt to steer the French economy into calmer waters.\nMPs from the far-left and far-right parties opposed the passing of the budget. They subsequently joined forces to back the no-confidence vote, with 331 legislators voting in favor of the motion, out of a total of 577 lawmakers.\nThe development threatens to plunge the country deeper into political turmoil.\nMacron appointed Barnier as prime minister on September 5, after snap elections in the summer produced a hung parliament in which no party won an outright majority.\nThe National Assembly has since been split into three distinct blocs, with 182 seats for the leftist coalition, 168 for President Macron's centrists and 143 for the far-right National Rally, headed by Marine Le Pen.\nThe divided lower house has made it tough for the government to push through legislation, including the 2025 budget.\nThough Macron is expected to appoint a new prime minister, they will face the same challenges that led to Barnier's downfall.\nThe political instability has raised concerns about France’s economy, with fears that the government's collapse could push up interest rates on French bonds, aggravating the country's debt woes.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSome opposition politicians have called for Macron to step down.\n\"I believe that stability requires the departure of the president of the Republic,\" said Manuel Bompard, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, on BFM TV Wednesday night.\nBut Macron has dismissed such calls. \"I was elected to serve until 2027, and I will fulfill that mandate,\" he told reporters earlier this week.\nThe political stalemate will likely continue as new parliamentary elections cannot be held until next summer.\nsri/rc (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa)"

The group quickly captured the city of Aleppo, which has never been out of government hands in over a decade of civil war in Syria.\nControl of Hama is considered strategically significant because the city connects Aleppo with the capital Damascus. Moreover, although Hama city was home to large protests against Assad's rule in 2011, the province is home to a great number of Alawites. This is the community from which Assad hails and provides a strong base of support for the president.\nThe United Nations has said that hundreds of people, mostly fighters, have been killed in the latest flare-up of violence in Syria, and some 115,000 have had to flee their homes.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn 2011, Assad led a brutal clampdown on Arab Spring protests calling for an end to his authoritarian rule, leading to the outbreak of the Syrian civil war.\nParties to the conflict have changed over the years, and have included groups that ran the ideological gamut from moderate rebels who sprang out of the protest movement to the extremist \"Islamic State\" (IS) group.\nFollowing the defeat of IS, things were relatively quiet for a time.\nThe most recent spate of attacks has been led by HTS, an al-Qaeda offshoot that has pro-Turkish leanings. Turkey has long been opposed to Assad.\nHTS is based out of Idlib, one of the last rebel bastions in Syria.\nSupporting Assad both diplomatically and at times militarily over the years has been Russia and Iran, who continue to do so now.

Local authorities say the victims likely died of smoke inhalation.\nTen people have died and two others are critically injured after a blaze at a nursing home near the northeastern Spanish city of Zaragoza on Friday morning.\nThe fire broke out at around 5 a.m. and remained concentrated in one room, but smoke spread throughout the establishment in the small town of Villafranca de Ebro, about 28 kilometers (18 miles) from Zaragoza.\nAccording to local mayor Volga Ramirez Gamiz, it was likely the smoke which caused the fatalities rather than the flames themselves, which were extinguished by firefighters.\n\"Fortunately, that room has a security door,\" which prevented the fire from spreading, she said. \"But there was a lot of smoke, outside too, you couldn't even breathe.\"\nInitially opened in 2008 as a care home for the elderly, the Jardines de Villafranca residence had recently begun to take in people of all ages suffering with dementia and other mental health problems.\n\"There are people from all walks of life, with many problems. Very young people, because there are people as young as 25 years old. In other words, we are not just talking about older people,\" said Gamiz.\nShe added that many of the residents had \"mobility problems\" which made it difficult to evacuate them quickly.\nAccording to local authorities, 82 residents and two staff members were in the building at the outbreak of the fire, the cause of which is unknown.\n\"We must stand with the victims of this regrettable event which has left 10 people dead and two in a critical condition,\" said Angel Victor Torres, the government minister in charge of cooperation with Spain's regions, speaking to public broadcaster TVE.\n\"Hopefully these two people will recover,\" he added.\nSocialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez said he was \"shocked by the tragedy,\" adding his hope that \"the people who are in a serious condition recover as soon as possible.\"\nMadrid's representative in the Aragon region, Fernando Beltran, told reporters that an investigation would be opened.\n\"The cause of death of each of these 10 people I cannot say yet, because it is under investigation,\" he said.\n\"But in a phenomenon of this nature, the highest number of deaths is usually due to smoke inhalation.\"\nThe fire, the third such deadly incident at a Spanish nursing home since 2022, took place just two weeks after devastating flash floods killed over 200 people and destroyed thousands of homes in the Valencia region, 300 kilometers (186 miles) to the south.\nmf/lo (AFP, dpa)"

    "content": "US envoy Amos Hochstein has said there is a \"real opportunity\" to end the Israel-Hezbollah war. He was in Beirut to discuss a draft cease-fire proposal. DW has more.\nAn end to fighting in Lebanon is \"within our grasp,\" said the Biden Administration's envoy to Israel and Lebanon on Tuesday.\nAmos Hochstein held talks in Beirut about a cease-fire proposal that could see both Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops withdrawing from a UN buffer zone in southern Lebanon.\nMeanwhile, UNICEF reports more than 200 children killed in Lebanon in the past two months\nWe have stopped adding to these updates.\nThis is a summary of major developments inthe conflicts in the Middle East on November 19, 2024:\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday promised safe passage from Gaza as well as large sums of cash to anyone there willing to help Israel free hostages held by the Islamist militant group Hamas.\n\"To those who want to leave this maze, I say: Whoever brings us a hostage will find a safe way for he and his family to get out. We will also give $5 million [€4.72 million] for every hostage,\" Netanyahu said during a brief visit to central Gaza.\n\"The choice is yours but the result will be the same… we will bring them all back,\" he concluded.\nHamas, which controls Gaza and took the hostages on October 7, 2023, has dismissed similar previous offers, saying it will only free the hostages in exchange for an end to the current war as well as reconstruction of the Gaza Strip.\nIt is estimated that roughly 100 of the original 250 individuals abducted by Hamas are still in their control. It is unclear how many of those still unaccounted for remain alive.\nDuring his statement, Netanyahu also said that Hamas would not govern Gaza in the future.\nWhile he says he is doing everything in his power to free the hostages, many in Israel blame him for their continued captivity, claiming he refuses to end the conflict in order to stay in power. They say his fragile coalition could collapse once a deal is inked.\nThere have been regular protests against Netanyahu's government in the country in recent months, often criticizing the intelligence failures that led to the original attack and what some see as Netanyahu's inability to bring the fighting to a conclusion and safely return the hostages.\nThe US Department of the Treasury on Tuesday announced that it had issued sanctions against several leaders of the militant Islamist group Hamas.\nA total of six individuals, including Basem Naim and Ghazi Hamad, senior leaders in the group, were put on the US sanctions list.\nThe move comes as international mediators seek to facilitate an end to the ongoing conflict in the Gaza Strip and the wider region. The sanctions are seen as a possible lever to force the release of hostages still held by Hamas and bring about a lasting cease-fire.\nAccording to the Treasury, the measures target the group's fundraising and arms smuggling operations.\n\"Hamas continues to rely on key officials who seemingly maintain legitimate, public-facing roles within the group, yet who facilitate their terrorist activities, represent their interests abroad, and coordinate the transfer of money and goods into Gaza,\" the Treasury's acting undersecretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, Bradley Smith, said in the statement.\n\"Treasury remains committed to disrupting Hamas' efforts to secure additional revenue and holding those who facilitate the group's terrorist activities to account,\" Smith added.\nWith three of the sanctioned individuals living in Turkey, the US warned Ankara about harboring Hamas leaders, saying they should not be living comfortably.\nThe US, Israel, Germany, the EU and other governments define Hamas as a terrorist organization. The group's October 7, 2023, attack on Israel — which saw nearly 1,200 Israelis killed and about 250 kidnapped — sparked the current conflict.\nMore than 43,000 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the Hamas-run Health Ministry.

We rely on the recent global coalition on the two states. We rely on the ICJ ruling that has called for the dismantlement of occupation. So all of this together, in an accumulative effort, might be able to push us a bit forward.

I am here in Beirut to facilitate that decision but it's ultimately the decision of the parties to reach a conclusion to this conflict.

The resolution obliges all armed groups apart from the Lebanese military and UN peacekeepers to leave the region along the border with Israel.\nIn Lebanon, the talks have been conducted with caretaker Prime Minister Najib Mikati and parliamentary speaker Nabih Berri who has been leading negotiations on behalf of Hezbollah.\nUS State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said on Monday that the draft had been discussed with Lebanese and Israeli officials, saying that: \"Both sides have reacted to the proposals that we have put forward.\"\nHowever, also on Monday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would continue its operations against Iran-backed Hezbollah even if a cease-fire deal was reached.\nHezbollah is considered a terrorist group by Israel, the US and several Sunni Arab states. At the same time, Israel has been accused of genocide and war crimes for its operations in Gaza by several international organizations including a UN committee, with Netanyahu being investigated by the International Criminal Court. Israel has repeatedly rejected the accusations.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIsrael has continued its strikes in central Beirut, with an attack on Monday killing five people, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.\nThe strikes on central Beirut have become more frequent following weeks of bombardments against southern neighborhoods of the Lebanese capital where Hezbollah is strongest.\nThe Iran-backed group also continued its strikes against Israel on Monday, firing around 100 rockets into northern Israel, killing a woman in the town of Shfaram, just east of Haifa.\nMeanwhile, in Gaza, the Health Ministry said that some 43,922 people, mostly civilians, had been killed in the Hamas-run enclave since October 7, 2023. The UN considers the figures reliable while other sources have suggested the death toll is likely to be much higher. The war in Gaza began after the October 7 Hamas terror attacks on Israel that killed some 1,200 people.\nMembers of the G20, who are meeting for a summit in Brazil, issued a joint statement on Monday calling for \"comprehensive\" cease-fires in both Lebanon and Gaza.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nab/sms (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa)"

    "content": "The ouster of Prime Minister Michel Barnier's minority government threatens to plunge France into political turmoil. President Emmanuel Macron said he would name a new prime minister in the coming days.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron addressed the nation on Thursday, hours after Prime Minister Michel Barnier handed in his resignation following Wednesday's vote of no-confidence.\nMacron rejected calls from the opposition to follow Barnier in stepping down, saying he would remain in office until the next presidential election in 2027.\nHe vowed to \"appoint a prime minister in the coming days\" saying that this person would be tasked with forming a \"government of general interest\" in order to pass a budget.\nThe president also accused the left-wing and far-right parties that voted to topple the prime minister of being an \"anti-republican front.\"\n\"They are not thinking about your lives, let's be honest. They are thinking of just one thing: the presidential election,\" he said during his televised address.\nBarnier met with Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris on Thursday to submit his resignation, making him the shortest-serving prime minister in modern French history.\n\"The prime minister today submitted the resignation of his government\" to Macron, who has \"taken note\" of the resignation, the Elysee said.\nBarnier and his ministers remain \"in charge of daily business until the appointment of a new government,\" it added.\nThe premier stepped down after lawmakers voted to oust his minority government in a no-confidence motion on Wednesday.\nThe move came after Barnier forced through an unpopular budget bill in an attempt to cut France's high fiscal deficit.\nThe plan contained tax increases and spending cuts worth €60 billion ($63.1 billion), aimed at bringing the deficit to 5% of economic output in 2025 from an estimated 6.1% this year. The aim is to trim the deficit down to 3% by 2029.\nIt was seen as an attempt to steer the French economy into calmer waters.\nMPs from the far-left and far-right parties opposed the passing of the budget. They subsequently joined forces to back the no-confidence vote, with 331 legislators voting in favor of the motion, out of a total of 577 lawmakers.\nThe development threatens to plunge the country deeper into political turmoil.\nMacron appointed Barnier as prime minister on September 5, after snap elections in the summer produced a hung parliament in which no party won an outright majority.\nThe National Assembly has since been split into three distinct blocs, with 182 seats for the leftist coalition, 168 for President Macron's centrists and 143 for the far-right National Rally, headed by Marine Le Pen.\nThe divided lower house has made it tough for the government to push through legislation, including the 2025 budget.\nThough Macron is expected to appoint a new prime minister, they will face the same challenges that led to Barnier's downfall.\nThe political instability has raised concerns about France’s economy, with fears that the government's collapse could push up interest rates on French bonds, aggravating the country's debt woes.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSome opposition politicians have called for Macron to step down.\n\"I believe that stability requires the departure of the president of the Republic,\" said Manuel Bompard, leader of the far-left France Unbowed party, on BFM TV Wednesday night.\nBut Macron has dismissed such calls. \"I was elected to serve until 2027, and I will fulfill that mandate,\" he told reporters earlier this week.\nThe political stalemate will likely continue as new parliamentary elections cannot be held until next summer.\nsri/rc (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa)"

Because of that, we start seeing each other as opponent instead of fellow citizens,\" she said in a statement.\nHad the NSC decided to leave the coalition, the government would have lost its majority in parliament.\nThe leader of the Green-left-Socialist opposition, Frans Timmermans, praised Achahbar's decision.\n\"In this government, racist remarks are the order of the day,\" he said. \"This government is not for all Dutch people.\"\nThe Dutch coalition includes the far-right Party for Freedom, led by populist Geert Wilders, which won elections last year.\nLast Wednesday, Wilders blamed Moroccans for the attacks on Israeli fans.\nWilders claimed that \"we saw Muslims hunting Jews,\" adding that it was fueled by \"Moroccans who want to destroy Jews.\"\nHe said those convicted of involvement in the violence should be deported if they have dual citizenship. He also called for the attackers to be prosecuted \"for terrorism.\"\nSchoof, meanwhile, said the integration of Dutch Moroccans had failed.\nThe ruling coalition led by Schoof has 88 seats in the 150-seat lower house.

    "content": "France could face an economic crisis after lawmakers voted to oust Prime Minister Michel Barnier's government after just three months. Rising bond yields and a spate of bankruptcies are making investors nervous.\nWhen Prime Minister Michel Barnier unveiled his deficit-reduction plan in October, promising to bring down the public deficit from around 6% of GDP to 3% in 2029, it was seen as an attempt to steer the French economy into calmer waters.\nBut on Wednesday, France's parliament rejected his proposal by voting to oust Barnier's government, upending his hopes of avoiding an economic storm.\nFor the first time in over 60 years, the National Assembly approved a no-confidence motion, proposed by the hard left and crucially backed by the far right headed by Marine Le Pen.\nLawmakers were reacting to Barnier's decision to link a vote on a part of the 2025 budget — a first step to get the deficit on track to comply with the European Union's fiscal rules — to a special constitutional vehicle, which only allows for bills to be stopped through a motion of censure.\nOn Thursday, Barnier submitted his resignation, but said he would stay on until a new government is formed.\nBefore this week's commotion, the prime minister lacked a majority in parliament and headed a coalition government comprising President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party and the conservative Republicans after snap parliamentary elections in July. Macron called those elections after his party came second in June's EU parliamentary elections, receiving less than half as many votes as the far-right National Rally.\nWhat seemed to be Barnier's only way of getting the budget through parliament has now backfired.\nThe latest crisis comes at a time when some of the economic indicators have been relatively stable. French GDP is predicted to grow by 1.1% this year while Germany's GDP is expected to shrink by 0.2%. Unemployment stands at 7.4%, which is relatively low for France. Inflation has gone down to about 2% from 5% a couple of years ago.\nHowever, for Denis Ferrand, head of Paris-based economic research institute Rexecode, these relatively good figures can't hide that the French economy has weakened over the past few years.\n\"French and European companies have become less competitive with Chinese ones, as our production costs have risen by 25% since 2019. They only went up by 3% in China over the same period,\" he told DW.\nFerrand puts that down to years of high inflation, rising interest rates, and soaring energy prices, especially after Russia invaded Ukraine in February 2022, which he said had led to \"a lot of caution.\"\n\"We do a quarterly survey amongst bosses of 1,000 French small and medium-sized companies about their investment behavior and, in October, only 36% of them were planning to maintain their investments with 45% saying they'd postpone them and 18% wanting to cancel them,\" Ferrand said.\n\"That trend started to emerge at the beginning of the year, but it really gained traction after July's snap parliamentary elections,\" he added.\nA mid-November survey by UK consultancy Ernest & Young (EY) among 200 international company bosses yielded similar results: roughly half of those questioned had downsized or postponed their investment projects. France has been top of EY's investment attractiveness survey in Europe since 2019.\nPhilippe Druon, a bankruptcy and restructuring lawyer at Paris-based law office Hogan Lovells, confirms that investors are cautious.\n\"It's very difficult to find buyers for companies that have gone into administration. I currently manage 60 such cases, which is a lot,\" he told DW, adding that the number of bankruptcies was as high as it was during the 2008 financial crisis.\nAbout 65,000 companies are expected to file for insolvency this year compared to 56,000 last year.\nDruon thinks the rise is only partly down to a catch-up effect.\n\"Many companies now have to pay back loans that the government handed out during the COVID-19 epidemic, but there are also structural reasons such as the transition to electric cars and the fact that there's less demand for office space as many employees now choose to work from home,\" he said.\n\"What's more, interest rates on the capital market have been relatively high which makes investing in companies less appealing,\" he added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAnd yet, Anne-Sophie Alsif, chief economist at Paris-based consultancy BDO, says these factors on their own wouldn't make for a dramatic economic situation. The political factor, however, does.\n\"Our macroeconomic figures were about to improve, but if the government falls now and no tailor-made 2025 budget gets voted through parliament, we'll be sliding into an economic crisis. It would be catastrophic,\" she told DW ahead of the vote.\n\"We would signal to investors that our country is incapable of implementing a deficit-reduction plan,\" Alsif stressed.\nIf the government gets voted out, she said, the 2024 budget will likely be replicated in 2025. \"But that was the budget that increased our deficit to over 6%.\"\n\"Macron's decision to dissolve Parliament was a monumental mistake. We are now forced to govern our country through coalitions, but we're incapable of that and thus facing an extremely unstable political situation,\" she added.\nChristopher Dembik, an investment advisor at the Paris subsidiary of Swiss-based Pictet Asset Management, has a different view of the situation.\n\"It's exaggerated to say France is on the brink of a financial crisis. That would mean the country wouldn't be able to refinance its debt, like Greece in 2009, and markets aren't indicating that right now,\" he told DW.\n\"Managers of US investment funds have been telling me that they've already taken into account France's political risk in their calculations and France's current spread — the gap in interest rates for 10-year government bonds compared to those issued by Germany — amounts to 0.8 percentage points which is more than acceptable,\" Dembik said.\nFrance currently pays interest rates of about 3% on these bonds.\nNonetheless, France recently paid a higher rate than Greece for the first time. And up until July's snap elections, the spread only stood at 0.5 percentage points.\nAs a result, Ferrand fears that France might not be able to avoid a financial crisis.\n\"Paris has always relied on the fact that it's too big to fail for other European countries,\" he said. \"But people in Brussels are starting to lose patience with our apparent incapacity to bring down public debt.\"\nEdited by: Nik Martin\nEditor's note. This article was first published on December 3, 2024, and was updated on December 4 and 5 to reflect the result of the vote in the National Assembly that ousted Barnier's government and his subsequent resignation."

Ghany's HTS is the group that has made the most military gains and that spearheaded the sudden resurgence that can now be observed in other parts of the country.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nPro-government radio station Sham FM said government forces had taken up positions outside the city but did not provide any further details.\nNews agency Reuters also cited a Syrian army officer, who it did not name, as saying that units of Lebanese group Hezbollah's elite Radwan forces had left the city.\nHoms and the surrounding area is considered strategically important in the conflict, not just as it is the country's third-largest city.\nShould HTS forces be able to control the roads around the city, it would cut the capital Damascus off from Syria's coastline and ports, at least if moving within Syrian territory, with Assad forces still largely in control of coastal provinces.\nThe governments of Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Joran, Egypt, Iraq, Iran, Turkey and Russia issued a joint statement late on Saturday after emergency talks in Astana, Kazakhstan.\n\"The participants stressed in a joint statement regarding the recent events in Syria, that the continuation of the Syrian crisis constitutes a dangerous development for the safety of the country and regional and international security,\" according to an English document shared online by Qatar's Foreign Ministry.\nThe countries said the situation \"requires all parties to seek a political solution to the Syrian crisis that leads to an end of military operations, and protection of civilians from the repercussions of the crisis.\"\nThey also called for additional international efforts to provide humanitarian aid.\nThe countries \"stressed the need to stop military operations in preparation for launching a comprehensive political process, based on Security Council Resolution 2254.\"\nThis referred to a 2015 appeal for some kind of political negotiations to end the conflict, which came before Assad's forces appeared to more or less pacify most of the country with support from allies like Russia, Iran and Hezbollah.\nCountries like Turkey, Saudi Arabia and Qatar, meanwhile, were typically seen to back Syrian rebels, or at least some of them, during the conflict.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSyria's Interior Minister Mohammed al-Rahmoun appeared on state television on Saturday, looking to assure people that the capital Damascus and its surroundings were well protected.\n\"There is a very strong security and military cordon on the far edges of Damascus and its countryside, and no one... can penetrate this defensive line that we, the armed forces, are building,\" al-Rahmoun said.\nThis comes as rebel groups in two provinces south of Damascus, Daraa and Sweida, seized various government facilities as Assad forces withdrew north toward the capital.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe bulk of the fighting during the rapid gains by rebels in the last week has been to the north of Damascus, with Assad forces losing ground to the Turkish-affiliated HTS group.\nHTS is still fighting for control of the city and wider area around Homs, around 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of the capital.\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights monitoring group reported large numbers of army reinforcements entering that region.\nSyria's Defense Ministry also sought to reassure those in the capital, saying there was \"no truth\" to reports of its forces withdrawing from positions on the outskirts of the capital.\nThe Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Saturday released a statement saying IDF soldiers were assisting United Nations forces under fire in the Golan Heights.\n\"A short while ago, an attack was carried out by armed individuals at a UN post in the Hader area in Syria,\" the IDF said on X, formerly Twitter. \"The IDF is currently assisting the UN forces in repelling the attack.\"\nJust hours earlier, the Israeli military announced the reinforcement of its presence in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights at the Syrian border.\n\"The reinforcement of forces will enable the strengthening of defense in the area, and the preparation of forces for various scenarios in the sector,\" the statement said.\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he hopes Syria \"finds peace\" as armed groups push ahead in their offensive against President Bashar Assad's government.\n\"Our wish is for our neighbor, Syria, to find the peace and tranquility it has been dreaming of for 13 years,\" Erdogan said, speaking in Gaziantep, a city less than 30 miles (48 kilometers) from the Syrian border.\nHe said that Syria is \"tired of war, blood and tears.\"\nTurkey is home to some three million Syrian refugees. Ankara-backed factions control parts of northern Syria and Turkey has led several military incursions into the country throughout the civil war.\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has said his country should \"not get involved\" in the situation in Syria, calling it a \"mess.\"\nShortly before a scheduled meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris, where he is due to attend the reopening ceremony of the Notre Dame cathedral, Trump commented on the situation in the Middle Eastern country on his Truth Social platform.\n\"Syria is a mess, but is not our friend, & THE UNITED STATES SHOULD HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

The square bears Hafez's name.\nAnother witness said the statue was later smashed.\nHafez was the father of current President Bashar Assad.\nJaramana lies some 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) southeast of downtown Damascus and is predominantly inhabited by Druze and Christians.\nThe protesters were calling for the downfall of Assad's government, according to witnesses cited by news agencies.\nRussia and Iran, which back Syrian President Bashar Assad, and Turkey, which backs the rebels in Syria, have agreed that there needs to be an immediate end to \"hostilities,\" Russia Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said in a meeting in Doha on Saturday.\nSpeaking at the annual Doha Forum, Lavrov said Moscow continues to help the Syrian army confront the rebels.\n\"We are very sorry for the Syrian people who became a subject of another geopolitical experiment,\" he said, blaming the US and the West for what's happening in Syria. \"We are doing everything we can not to make terrorists prevail, even if they say they are not terrorists.\"\nLavrov was referring to Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, an Islamist group leading the latest campaign against Assad.\nThe group was labeled a foreign terrorist organization by the US in 2018, and was previously affiliated with al-Qaeda, another US-designated terror outfit.\n\"It's inadmissible to allow the terrorist group to take control of the lands in violation of agreements which exist, starting with the UN Security Council Resolution 2254 which strongly reiterated sovereignty, territorial integrity and unity of the Syrian Arab Republic,\" Lavrov said.\nLavrov said Russia wanted to see dialogue between the Syrian government and what he called the \"legitimate opposition\" in Syria.\nWhen asked whether he thinks the current events were threatening Assad's rule, Lavrov said: \"We are not in the business of guessing what's going to happen.\"\nSyrian rebel forces have taken the southern town of Sanamayn and advanced to within 20 kilometers (12 miles) of the capital, Damascus, rebel commander Hassan Abdul-Ghani said on Saturday.\nAbdul-Ghani is a commander within the Islamist-led alliance that has launched the ongoing offensive in the country's northwest.\nSanamayn, on the main highway from Damascus to Jordan, is situated in southern Daraa province.\nAccording to the head of the Britain-based war monitor Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, Rami Abdel Rahman, the province is now completely in the hands of local rebel fighters.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe current security developments in Syria have prompted the United Nations to pull its nonessential staff from the country, while Jordan has joined the growing list of countries urging their citizens to depart.\nA UN spokesperson said that the world body would continue its services to support people in Syria despite the partial withdrawal.\nJordan, which has already closed its border crossing with Syria, called on its citizens to leave the country \"as soon as possible.\"\nSyria is seeing an intense flare-up of its long-running civil war as an Islamist-led rebel group continues to push on with a lightning offensive that aims to overthrow the government.\nQatari Prime Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani has said he feels that Syrian President Bashar Assad did not make use of a period of calm in his country's civil war to try to reconcile with the populace.\n\"Assad didn't seize these opportunities to start engaging and restoring his relationship with his people, and we didn't see any serious movement, whether it's on the return of the refugees or on reconciling with his own people,\" he said at the Doha Forum for political dialogue.\nAl-Thani also voiced concern that the civil war could threaten Syria's territorial integrity if no political solution to the conflict were found.\nThe Doha Forum was founded in 2003 with the aim of bringing together leaders to discuss global challenges. It is taking place this year on December 7-8.\nThe Israeli military says it is reinforcing its presence in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights near the Syrian border.\n\"In accordance with the assessment of the situation, it was decided to further reinforce forces for defense missions in the Golan Heights area, near the Syrian border,\" an Israeli Defense Forces spokesperson wrote on Telegram.\n\"The reinforcement of forces will enable the strengthening of defense in the area, and the preparation of forces for various scenarios in the sector,\" the statement continued."

The storm also caused floods in Ireland, cutting power to tens of thousands.\nIreland and Britain were battered by winter storm Bert on Saturday, which brought strong winds, heavy rain, snow and ice that UK forecasters called a \"multi-hazard\" event.\nThe severe weather closed roads, airports, ferry and train routes on both sides of the Irish Sea.\nOne person died near Winchester, in southern England, after a tree fell onto a car on a major highway, police said.\nA second death from a traffic accident in West Yorkshire, in northern England, was also being investigated by police to see if it was linked to the storm. According to reports, the road was not icy at the time of the incident.\nFive adults and five children were rescued from a house after a landslide in north Wales, Sky News reported.\nIreland's meteorological service placed a \"status red\" rain warning — its highest level — for the populous counties of Cork and Galway overnight.\nThe heavy rain led to flooding in parts of the west coast of Ireland, making some roads impassable. In the County Donegal town of Killybegs, floodwater was seen rising to the top of parked cars.\nAcross Ireland, Storm Bert left at least 60,000 properties without power overnight. By Saturday evening, that number had fallen to 11,000. In Britain, nearly 27,000 homes across northern England had their electricity cut.\nMeanwhile, in France, tens of thousands remained without power after Storm Caetano on Thursday.\nSeveral hundred passengers were stranded on two trains in western France on Saturday that were halted for up to 9 hours by power cuts.\nThe heaviest snow hit Scotland and parts of northern and central England, with dozens of flood alerts in place, and several roads closed.\nThe National Highways agency warned of \"blizzard conditions\" affecting Yorkshire and northeast England.\nIn its latest snow and ice warning, the UK Met Office said there was a \"good chance some rural communities could be cut off.\"\nThe Queensferry Crossing, a bridge over the Forth of Firth, near Edinburgh, was closed due to falling ice on the carriageway.\nFlights were disrupted at Newcastle Airport due to heavy snow, with some flights diverted to Belfast and Edinburgh.\nThe main operator of rail services between England and Scotland said it cancelled numerous trains and advised rail users not to attempt to travel beyond Preston, a city north of Manchester.\nAnother rail operator, serving western England and Wales, asked passengers to only travel west of Basingstoke, about 90 minutes by train from London, if their journeys were essential.\nSome train services in Scotland were also canceled, including the Inverness-Elgin and Aberdeen-Inverurie routes  , which are popular with tourists in Scotland.\nIn Yorkshire, the main highways crossing the Peak District national park were closed due to snow, along with a highway from the industrial northeast city of Middlesborough to the Lake District.\nFurther south, ferry operator DFDS cancelled services due to strong winds in the English Channel, with sailings from Newhaven and Dover in southern England to Dieppe and Calais in France severely affected.\nmm/lo (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)"

    "content": "French lawmakers have rejected a draft budget for 2025, while Germany is also going into the new year without a final spending plan.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz and French Prime Minister Michel Barnier have similar problems at the moment: They would like to push through policies, but do not have enough funds from parliament to do so.\nOn Tuesday, France's lower house, the National Assembly, overwhelmingly rejected the first part of the budget for 2025, which involved revenues, by a large majority. While 392 lawmakers voted against it, 192 lawmakers from the government camp and from the far-right National Rally voted in favor. The vote came after a two-week debate in which the left-wing New Popular Front alliance, which makes up the largest political bloc in parliament, had reshaped the bill with amendments.\nThese included wealth tax on billionaires, a tax hike on \"super-dividends\" from large corporations, a tax on multinationals and higher taxes for digital companies, as well as a new tax for particularly loud motorcycles. Lawmakers had also scrapped the government's plans to impose higher taxes on electricity and gas heating, and not replaced it.\nThe national budget is a government program expressed in figures. In these times of upheaval, these figures are lacking in both Berlin and Paris.\nWhile Barnier can still hope for a regular budget in 2025 despite this defeat, the current minority government in Berlin cannot. At best, a supplementary budget for 2024 could, with opposition support, be passed before the dissolution of the Bundestag ahead of a snap election in February.\nThis is necessary because the German government is still short of money. It needs €3.7 billion (ca. $3.9 billion) to cover additional expenditure for the Citizen's Allowance, a state welfare benefit for basic income support, and more than €10 billion to promote renewable energies. If it doesn't find this money before the end of the year, it will have to respond with a budget freeze.\nWhen US President-elect Donald Trump returns to the White House on January 20, the Bundestag will probably have been dissolved. Almost five weeks later, on February 23, Germans will then elect a new parliament. Depending on the results, the formation of a government could drag on well into spring.\nGermany will still have a chancellor and ministers after the dissolution of parliament by the president, but only in an executive capacity. During the transition phase, they will no longer be allowed to make fundamental or far-reaching decisions.\nOnly a new government will be able to negotiate with the new Trump administration or push ahead with decisions at the European Union level. Until then, Germany will have to wait and see.\nBut perhaps some will also be breathing a sigh of relief, as the coalition that has now failed has been considered a difficult partner in Brussels in recent years. In recent years, the coalition government repeatedly avoided making delicate decisions by abstaining, for example on the EU Supply Chain Act and on emissions regulations for trucks.\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron nominated 73-year-old Barnier from the conservative Republican party as prime minister after he dissolved parliament and prompted a fresh parliamentary election earlier this year. Even together, Macron's centrist alliance and the Republicans do not have a majority in the National Assembly. They also don't have a binding government program, despite Barnier being in office for two months now.\nThe fact that the 2025 budget failed in the National Assembly could help the prime minister, because it is not the amended draft that will go to the upper house, the Senate, but the government's original draft.\nThe cuts to social benefits and public spending totaling around €60 billion for the 2025 budget are likely to have an easier time in the conservative Senate than in the National Assembly, where the necessity for austerity is more controversial. In June, the European Commission launched an excessive deficit procedure against France and reprimanded it for breaking budget rules.\nCredit rating agencies are also keeping an eye on Paris. With a deficit of 6% of GDP this year and a mountain of debt amounting to 113% of GDP, France's budget situation is dramatic.\nShortly after Chancellor Scholz faces a vote of confidence in the Bundestag on December 16, the fate of his French counterpart could also be decided. According to the current timetable, the French budget for 2025 is due to be finalized by the joint mediation committee of both houses of parliament in the last week before Christmas. The National Assembly will then have to make the final decision.\nIt's quite possible that the French government, faced with the threat of defeat, will resort to Article 49.3 of the Constitution to pass the budget without a final vote. If the government relies on this special article, the opposition will have 24 hours to table a motion of censure. If this receives a majority, the government will have to resign and the draft budget will fail.\nIf this happens, the EU's two largest economies would be paralyzed and forced to resort to provisional budget management at the turn of a decisive year. In both countries, such budget management is limited to obligations that already exist or are legally prescribed and only intended to guarantee the basic functions of the state. Salaries, pensions and social benefits are covered but political projects remain on hold.\nScholz and Barnier will meet in the Berlin this coming week, when the latter makes his first official visit to the German capital as prime minister.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video"

    "content": "The advancing Islamist rebels in Syria's north have vowed to respect ethnic and religious groups under their rule. Observers, however, point to years of human rights abuses in areas under HTS control.\nIn light of the current offensive against forces of Syrian President Bashar Assad, the Sunni Islamist militia Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, or HTS, has promised not to crack down on minorities in areas that are now under their control.\nLast week, HTS,  which has been designated as a foreign terrorist organization by the US and the UN Security Council, seized swathes of villages in Syria's north as well as Aleppo, Syria's second largest city in a surprise attack.\n\"When they took over Aleppo, they reassured members of minority groups that they would allow them to coexist,\" Chrissie Steenkamp, an associate professor in Social and Political Change at UK's Oxford Brookes University, told DW.\n\"HTS do like to portray themselves as being not quite as oppressive to minority groups and other religions,\" Steenkamp said.\nAs a consequence of Syria's almost 14 years of civil war, during which half a million people have been killed and which has left the country deeply fractured, there are neither accurate nor up-to-date statistics about ethnic and religious minorities in Syria.\nHowever, estimates are widely similar in stating that Syria's population of close to 25 million people comprises around 70% Sunni Muslims, 13% Shia Muslims of which around 10% account as Alawites, as well as the country's Kurdish, Christian and Druze minorities.\nFor the past five years, HTS, which translates into \"Organization for the Liberation of the Levant,\" has already been acting as de-facto administration of Syria's last major oppositional stronghold in the country's northwestern region of Idlib with around 4 million mostly displaced Syrians.\n\"Over this time, HTS has been opening up to religious minorities,\" Jerome Drevon, an International Crisis Group analyst who has met HTS leaders, told DW.\nFor example, HTS commanders have met Christian representatives to address their concerns, he said.\n\"The main issue was about housing as many Christian houses [in the Idlib region] had been seized by refugees from elsewhere in Syria,\" he explained, adding that \"HTS has restored those houses and lands to their Christian owners.\"\nSince 2018, Christians in the Idlib region have also been able to celebrate their religious holidays such as Easter or Christmas.\n\"Their rights have improved to a large extent,\" Drevon said, highlighting a similar process with the Druze minority.\nThe pro-Turkish HTS, which was founded in 2011, was initially linked to al-Qaeda militants, however, the groups split again as HTS is not seeking to build a global caliphate.\n\"They want to take over the Syrian regime [of President Bashar Assad] and create a new regime instead,\" Drevon told DW.\n\"For this, they have expressed their readiness to create strategic relations with Turkey, Iraq, and only a few days ago, they even had a communique saying that they could have relations with the Russians as well,\" he added.\nRussia, as well as Iran, are Assad's key allies while Turkey is among the supporters of the oppositional rebel groups.\n\"However, none of this changes the fact that there are many jihadists in its [HTS] ranks, and we must therefore expect that the organization also acts like a jihadist group that commits acts of violence against religious and ethnic minorities,\" Middle East analyst Guido Steinberg told the German news outlet tagesschau.de earlier this week.\nIn his view, this could mean \"a reign of terror for the population, especially in the districts of Aleppo populated by Christians and Kurds.\"\nHiba Zayadin, a senior researcher in the Middle East and North Africa Division of Human Rights Watch, doubts that HTS could go down in history as tolerant Islamists.\n\"The fear that minorities including Shias, Kurds, and Alawites might be feeling right now, stems from the poor human rights records of both HTS and factions of the Turkish-backed Syrian National Army who have joined HTS in its recent operation,\" Zayadin told DW.\n\"Previous abuses of both groups include mistreatment of religious and ethnic minorities including violence, forced displacement, as well as destruction of cultural and religious heritage,\" she added.\nHowever, Syria's minorities and political activists or dissidents are not only under threat in areas governed by Islamist rebels.\n\"In government-controlled areas, those perceived as opposing the regime, including because they hail from formerly or currently opposition-held areas or who are part of marginalized sects, including Sunnis and Kurds,\" also risk arbitrary detention, forced disappearance, and ongoing repression, Zayadin said, and she does not harbor much hope for a new dawn of human rights in Syria.\n\"Sectarian dynamics significantly shape the lived experiences of ethnic and religious groups who are often caught in a cycle of fear, displacement, and repression,\" she said.\nTo view this

I am asking you to contribute.\"\nScholz explicitly mentioned three pieces of legislation that he said would be in everyone's interest to agree on, whatever happens in the vote expected late in February.\nAll of them, he said, would contribute to \"easing the burden on citizens\" financially.\nScholz first cited moving tax brackets to avoid what's sometimes known as \"bracket creep,\" or \"cold progression\" in German — when inflation and resultant pay increases lead to people entering a higher tax bracket despite little or no discernible changes to their living standards.\nHe said that child welfare payments also needed adjusting.\nScholz also called for lawmakers to approve plans for continuing the discounted €58 (roughly $61) flat-fare monthly nationwide rail pass known as the \"Deutschlandticket.\"\nThe chancellor greeted leading CDU politicians Friedrich Merz, the candidate for chancellor, and Armin Laschet, the 2021 candidate, in the chamber ahead of the session. But the largest opposition party did not directly respond to or challenge his calls for support for passing legislation.\nScholz also spoke on Ukraine, following his trip to Kyiv on Monday and talks with President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nScholz said he'd told Zelenskyy that Ukraine could be assured of continued German support, but also said his goal was \"to develop concepts with Ukraine on how the war could one day end after all.\"\nHe said it was crucial that such discussions involved the government in Kyiv and that decisions were not made \"over Ukraine's head.\"\nScholz also tried to defend the more cautious parts of his approach to the conflict, like not providing longer-range Taurus missiles, saying that he would \"continue to do everything so that it doesn't come to a further escalation,\" particularly a conflict between Russia and NATO.\nScholz said that the Taurus was a \"very, very far-reaching weapon\" with high precision and potential for damage.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe chancellor said Zelenskyy had also asked him to do more to ensure that Ukrainians who fled to Germany after Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion find work.\nZelenskyy wanted to set up a Ukrainian authority for countries like Germany and Poland that would support people to this end, Scholz told the chamber.\n\"Many have been here for a long time now and really should be getting started,\" he said.\n'I also want to be my own successor'\nWednesday's session was the first monthly Q&A with the chancellor, a concept loosely modeled on Prime Ministers' Questions in the UK and introduced around a decade ago, since Scholz confirmed he would be triggering early elections in February and the SPD confirmed Scholz would again be their lead candidate.\nThis followed him firing Free Democrat (FDP) Finance Minister Christian Lindner, leading to the withdrawal of FDP support for his formerly three-party coalition, also including his Social Democrats and the Greens.\nSpeaking of his ambitions in the aftermath of the vote, Scholz repeated what appears a bold goal for the SPD as they languish in third place in most nationwide polls.\n\"I also want to be my own successor,\" Scholz said, as the party hopes for a late rebound in support akin to the one it enjoyed in 2021's national election campaign.\nPolls currently put the CDU/CSU on more than 30% support, more than double the roughly 15% enjoyed by the SPD, with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) on around 19%.\nThe SPD has never finished outside the top two in a post-war German election.\nmsh/ab (AFP, dpa, epd)\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

And we do what we say.”\nDuring his visit, Scholz will hold talks with Zelenskyy, who is set to push NATO to invite Ukraine to join the military alliance at a meeting in Brussels later this week.\n\n\n\nZelenskyy had recently criticised Scholz after the German leader held a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss ways to end the war. The Ukrainian leader had said the move would open a “Pandora’s box” by weakening Putin’s international isolation.\nScholz’s visit also comes as he faces a tough battle for re-election at a snap vote in February after his coalition collapsed in November.\nHis record of supporting Ukraine has been under scrutiny both from those who wanted him to do more to help Kyiv and, on the other side, those voters who want Germany to pull back from sending weapons and aid to Ukraine.\nMeanwhile, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said Putin is dragging Asia into the war in Ukraine with the use of Chinese-made drones and the deployment of North Korean troops.\n“Drones from Chinese factories and North Korean troops attacking peace in the centre of Europe violate our core European security interests,” Baerbock said after meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi, in Beijing.\nAmid the continuing military advance by Russia into Ukraine, Zelenskyy said Ukraine must find diplomatic solutions to retake some of its occupied territory.\nHe said such steps could be considered “only when we know that we are strong enough”, he said in an interview with the Japanese news agency Kyodo published on Monday.\nZelenskyy also said Trump and his team were studying the Ukrainian “victory plan” and expected additional talks with them to explain “certain things in more detail”, according to the report.\nMeanwhile, Ukraine’s air force reported that Russia launched 110 drones into the country overnight. One of the drones hit a residential building in the western city of Ternopil, killing one person and injuring several others.\nOf the 110 drones, the air force shot down 52 and 50 were “lost”, likely due to electronic warfare, it said.\nOne drone remained in Ukrainian airspace and six of the drones headed towards Belarus and Russia, the air force added.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told Russian President Vladimir Putin on Friday that Russia’s deployment of North Korean troops against Ukraine was a “grave escalation” of the conflict, according to government sources.\nIn the first phone call between the leaders in nearly two years, Scholz called on Putin to end the war and pull Russian troops out of Ukraine.\nThe Kremlin described the conversation as \"a detailed and frank exchange of opinions on the situation in Ukraine”, adding \"the very fact of dialogue is positive\".\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said the call was a “Pandora’s box” and argued it weakens Putin's isolation.\nAccording to government sources, the chancellor condemned Russia’s attack on Ukraine and called on Moscow to negotiate with Kyiv to come to a “fair and lasting peace”.\nHe also stressed “Germany’s unwavering determination to support Ukraine in its defensive struggle against Russian aggression for as long as necessary”.\nScholz condemned in particular the Russian air strikes on civilian infrastructure.\nThe phone conversation lasted about an hour and both leaders agreed to stay in contact. Russian media is reporting that according to the Kremlin, the call was initiated by Germany.\nThe German government will be keen to avoid any accusations that Berlin is trying to strike a deal with Moscow over Ukraine’s head, particularly given painful 20th century memories in eastern Europe of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union carving up the region between them.\nIn a written statement, the chancellor’s office highlighted that Scholz also talked to Zelensky before the call to Putin. Scholz also planned to talk to Zelensky again once the call was over to give details about the conversation with the Russian president.\nIn a statement from the Kremlin to Russian media, Putin reportedly told Scholz that Russian-German relations had suffered \"an unprecedented degradation across the board as a result of the German authorities \"unfriendly course”.\nAccording to the Kremlin, Putin told Scholz that any potential peace agreement must “be based on the new territorial realities” — in other words the Ukrainian territory that Russia has occupied since 2022.\nPutin also said a peace deal could only happen by removing “the root causes of the conflict”. The Kremlin justifies its invasion of Ukraine with the accusation of Nato “expansion” into eastern Europe.\nIn the call, Putin reportedly said “the current crisis was a direct result of Nato's years-long aggressive policy aimed at creating in Ukrainian territory an anti-Russian bridgehead”.\nIn an interview on German television last Sunday, Scholz said he was planning to talk to Putin to push for peace talks. He said he was not acting on his own, but rather in consultation with others.\nThere is speculation that Scholz is planning to also talk to the Chinese president Xi Jinping, a lukewarm supporter of Russia, about the war in Ukraine at the G20 next week in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe last time Scholz talked to Putin on the phone was on 2 December 2022. They last met in person a week before the full invasion of Ukraine.\nAt the time, Scholz returned to Berlin with promises from Putin that Russia did not intend to invade Ukraine. The attack a week later was the final break in trust between Germany and Russia.\nFor decades, Berlin had tried to ensure peace with Moscow by binding the two countries together with trade and energy links. That aspiration shattered overnight when Russia launched its full invasion of Ukraine.\nToday, Germany is the largest donor of military and financial aid to Ukraine after the US, and mainstream politicians from across the political spectrum, as well as most voters, favour supporting Ukraine.\nBut with elections in Germany now due in February, pressure is growing for serious peace negotiations to end the war in Ukraine.\nThe far-right AfD and the new far-left populist BSW, which together could win between a quarter and third of votes in the election, accuse the government of not doing enough to bring about a peace deal.\nScholz’s governing coalition collapsed last week and he now runs a minority government until the elections. Both he and his party are doing badly in the polls.\nGermany has been hit hard by the war in Ukraine, both politically and economically.\nSo any sign that Scholz is helping to end the conflict could turn around his fortunes at the ballot box.\nAfter 50 years of brutal rule over Syria, Bashar al-Assad and his family have fled to Russia.\nA coroner rejects claims former soldier Daniel Burke of Manchester was accidentally shot by his comrade.\nThe Kremlin says the strikes were in response to Kyiv using US-made missiles to attack its territory.\nMark Rutte urged members to \"turbocharge\" their defence spending to prevent future war with Russia.\nThe presents have been donated by people from the city and beyond.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel has told the BBC the gas deals she made with Russia were intended to help German firms and kept the peace with Moscow.\nShe also insisted the war with Ukraine would have started earlier if she hadn’t blocked Kyiv’s entry into Nato in 2008.\nAngela Merkel led Germany for 16 years. She was in office during the financial crisis, the 2015 migrant crisis and, significantly, Russia’s 2014 invasion of Ukraine.\nWas she too soft on Moscow? Too slow to help Kyiv? If she hadn't blocked Ukraine’s Nato membership in 2008, would there be a war there now?\nSpeaking to the BBC in Berlin, Mrs Merkel is robust in her defence of her time in office.\nShe says she believes the war in Ukraine would have started sooner and  would likely have been worse, if Kyiv had begun the path to Nato membership in 2008.\n\"We would have seen military conflict even earlier. It was completely clear to me that President Putin would not have stood idly by and watched Ukraine join Nato.\n\"And back then, Ukraine as a country would certainly not have been as prepared as it was in February 2022.\"\nUkraine President Volodymyr Zelensky disagrees.\nHe describes Mrs Merkel’s Nato decision, backed by then-French President Nicolas Sarkozy, as a clear \"miscalculation\" that emboldened Russia.\nIn a rare interview since she stepped down from politics three years ago, Mrs Merkel expresses concern about Vladimir Putin’s renewed threats of using nuclear weapons.\nThe two leaders got to know each other well over the course of two decades.\n\"We must do everything possible to prevent the use of nuclear weapons,” the former German Chancellor says.\n\"Thankfully, China also spoke about this a while back. We shouldn't be paralysed by fear, but we must also acknowledge that Russia is the biggest, or alongside the US, one of the two biggest nuclear powers in the world.\n\"The potential is frightening.\"\nDespite enjoying high popularity ratings during most of her time in office, Mrs Merkel now finds herself on the defensive.\nShe has just published her memoir, Freedom. And the timing is interesting.\nShe says she did everything in her power to ensure peaceful means of co-operation with Russia.\nIn fact, Mr Putin launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine just months after she left office.\nThis prompted a thorough re-examination in Europe of energy policies, diplomacy with Russia and also migration policies that had become the norm under Mrs Merkel.\nAt the helm of Europe’s biggest economy, she was, as former Italian premier Matteo Renzi says, the de-facto leader of Europe - \"the boss of the European Union\".\n\"Do you remember when [former US Secretary of State] Henry Kissinger used to say 'what is the telephone number of Europe?',\" he says. \"My answer was: clearly, the mobile number of Angela Merkel.\"\nHe adds that when judging the Merkel legacy - over Russia and otherwise - it is important to remember the norms of the time.\n\"One cannot attack Angela for the relations with Russia,\" he says.\n\"In 2005, 2006 [they] were a goal of everyone in Europe, not only a goal of Angela Merkel.\"\nUnder Mrs Merkel, Germany and its energy-hungry big industries became dependent on Moscow. Germany built two gas pipelines directly linked to Russia.\nPresident Zelensky described that cheap gas as a geopolitical tool of the Kremlin.\nMrs Merkel tells the BBC she had two motives with the pipelines: German business interests but also maintaining peaceful links with Russia.\nFellow EU and Nato members in eastern Europe strongly disagreed with her.\nThe Polish MP, Radoslaw Fogiel, said German gas money filled Russia’s war chest -  used to fund the invasion of Ukraine.\nMrs Merkel insists she tried to curb Russian attacks on Ukraine using diplomacy and negotiations, which - she admits - ultimately failed.\nAnd German industry has been disproportionately hit by sanctions on Russian energy. Forced to look for other suppliers, the country is now buying expensive LNG. Businesses says they are crippled by the costs.\nA new era in Europe’s relations with Russia \"regrettably\" began following the full-scale invasion of Ukraine, says Mrs Merkel.\nOn Monday, defence ministers from the UK, France, Germany, Poland and Italy are meeting to discuss the deteriorating situation on Ukraine’s frontlines.\nMs Merkel, 70, now finds herself having to defend her legacy in other areas too.\nThe migration crisis of 2015, when she famously opened Germany’s doors to over a million asylum seekers, was perhaps the defining moment of her time in office.\nIt was hated by some, hailed by others.\nUS President Barack Obama praised her as a courageous and moral leader.\nBut critics blamed her for breathing life into the then almost redundant far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party.\nIt is now polling comfortably in second place in German public opinion polls, ahead of a snap general election early next year.\nThe AfD’s main political rallying cry: a strong anti-migrant message.\nAngela Merkel admits the AfD made big gains, but she makes no apology for her political decisions.\nAs for suggestions that her 2015 policies helped fuel anti-immigration and far-right parties elsewhere too, including the Netherlands, Poland and France, after she tried to impose migrant quotas across EU countries, Mrs Merkel says she can’t be held responsible for all of Europe.\nThe only way to combat the far right is to stop illegal migration, she says.\nShe calls on Europe’s leaders to invest more in African nations to improve standards of living there, so fewer people will be tempted to leave their homes.\nBut with Europe’s economies sluggish, and voters worried about the cost of living, governments say there is little cash to spare.\nAngela Merkel appeared to put her country and its economic interests first when it came to buying Russian energy or during the eurozone crisis - when southern EU nations blamed her for squeezing them with austerity measures in order to rescue German banks and businesses.\nBut even at home in Germany, she is now accused of simply \"managing\" successive crises and failing to make far-reaching, perhaps painful reforms to future-proof her country and the EU.\nGermany is now labelled by some as \"the sick man of Europe\".\nOnce an export powerhouse on the world stage, its economy hovers just above recession.\nVoters complain she failed to invest in roads, railways and digitalisation, in favour of maintaining a balanced budget.\nUnder Angela Merkel, Germany not only became reliant on Russia for energy, but on China and the US for trade. Those decisions have not stood the test of time.\nDonald Trump threatens punishing tariffs on imports when he returns to the White House in January.\nMrs Merkel does have some thoughts for Europe’s nervous leaders faced with  Trump 2.0.\nHis first term in office was marked by anger at Europe, particularly Germany, over low defence spending and trade deficits. Those gripes with Europe haven't changed.\nWhat are the Merkel tips for handling him?\n\"It’s really important to know what your priorities are, to present them clearly and not to be scared, because Donald Trump can be very outspoken,\" she says.\n\"He expresses himself very clearly. And if you do that, there is a certain mutual respect. That was my experience anyway.\"\nBut Europe’s leaders facing the US, China, and Russia, are apprehensive - arguably more so than during Angela Merkel’s time.\nEconomies are sluggish, voters unhappy, traditional politics under pressure from the far-right and the far-left.\nChina and Russia are more bullish, the West weaker on the world stage.\nWars burn in the Middle East and in Europe, with Donald Trump appearing less interested in bolstering European security.\nPerhaps that’s why Angela Merkel says, these days, when world leaders she knows well call her for advice, she happily responds.\nBut when I ask if she misses all that power and politics, her swift answer is: \"No, not at all.\"\nIn the UK, you can watch Katya Adler's full interview with Angela Merkel on BBC iPlayer.\nSome have long called for the practice of changing the clock twice a year to end.\nAs Argentina's libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his policies are keenly observed in the US.\nChina's ambassador is expected to attend and other officials may join him, two people told the BBC's US partner CBS.\nThe US president-elect comes into office with a strong economy, but investors hope for more and current highs may be difficult to sustain.\nThe incoming US president has vowed not to involve America in foreign conflicts, but Assad's dramatic fall has upended the region's balance of power.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The chancellor made a visit to reaffirm Berlin's support for Ukraine, but met with some criticism. Meanwhile, Ukraine's president said diplomatic solutions might help Kyiv reclaim some of its occupied land. DW has more.\nHere are the latest developments in Russia's war in Ukraine on Monday, December 2.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy expressed gratitude to German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for his visit to Kyiv on Monday.\n\"Today, Chancellor Scholz visited Ukraine. We had an extensive discussion — one of the longest bilateral meetings, in a special format, lasting more than two and a half hours,\" Zelenskyy said, while mentioning that the main focus of the talk was \"air defense and strengthening our protection of the skies.\"\nHe mentioned that Germany is number one in Europe regarding aid to Ukraine: \"I want to thank the Chancellor personally, as well as all of Germany — who stand so firmly with us. It is vital for Ukraine that the level of German support does not decrease in the future.\"\nZelenskyy said Scholz \"saw specific Ukrainian weapons produced jointly with Germany that can significantly influence the situation at the front.\"\nZelenskyy thanked German companies that are working with Ukraine, and said \"he discussed upcoming contacts with our European partners in the coming weeks, as well as the negotiations planned for this month\" with Scholz.\n\"Olaf, I want to personally thank you, and I extend my gratitude to your country — thank you, Germany!\" Zelenskyy said.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken announced a package of missiles, ammunition, anti-personnel mines and other weapons worth $725 million (roughly €690 million) for Ukraine on Monday.\nThis comes as the outgoing Biden administration looks to ramp up deliveries before the handover to President-elect Donald Trump in January, amid questions on how that might impact Washington's stance on the conflict.\nBlinken said in a statement that the package would include stinger missiles, ammunition for High Mobility Artillery Rocket Systems (or HIMARS), drones and land mines, among other items.\n\"The United States and 50 other nations stand united to ensure Ukraine has the capabilities it needs to defend itself against Russian aggression,\" Blinken said.\nRussia has been making gains in Ukraine's east in recent months and Russian airstrikes threaten the energy grid as winter sets in.\nIt's the first time in decades the US has exported anti-personnel landmines, with their use contentious because of the potential to harm civilians and for long-term contamination of areas.\nNeither Russia or the US are parties to the 1997 Ottawa Treaty banning their use, however, while Ukraine started requesting them soon after Russia's invasion.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has criticized German Chancellor Olaf Scholz for holding a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin in November, saying it could contribute to acknowledgment of the latter's goals in Ukraine.\n\"I don't think this strengthens Ukraine,\" said Zelenskyy, stood alongside Scholz in Kyiv.\n\"I think that one conversation can lead to a second, a third, a fifth, because then every head of state wants to take leadership,\" he argued, insisting:\n\"We can only ensure peace through strength, the strength of our weapons, our diplomacy, and our cooperation.\"\nScholz insisted that he told Putin during their conversation that Ukraine has the right to be an independent sovereign nation and urged the Russian leader to pull back his troops.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and visiting German Chancellor Olaf Scholz continued to differ over the questions of long-range German missile deliveries and Ukraine's potential membership of NATO.\nDespite the United States lifting restrictions on Kyiv's use of long-range American ATACMS missiles, and similar authorization given by the United Kingdom and France regarding the deployment of their Storm Shadow/SCALP equivalents, Scholz continues to withhold German Taurus missiles.\n\"It has to do with range and the need to control the target selection,\" he said, reiterating Berlin's argument that the high-tech weapons could only be deployed with targeting assistance from German personnel.\n\"For individual weapon systems, we have a certain assessment of whether it is right to make them available or not,\" Scholz said.\n\"The Taurus issue is a challenge,\" Zelenskyy responded, adding: \"We've heard a lot about Germany's position and we are working to have more common ground [on the matter].\"\nAsked what difference he thought Taurus missiles could make on the battlefield, he said: \"We could hit more military targets inside the Russian Federation.\"\nAs for Zelenskyy's long-term goal of an invitation for Ukraine to join NATO, Scholz evaded questions.\n\"NATO has already passed resolutions on this topic,\" he said, referring to recent alliance summits in Vilnius, Lithuania and Washington, D.C.\nOn Friday, Zelenskyy had signalled that an offer of NATO membership for territory still under Kyiv's control could end \"the hot stage of the war.\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz has once again stressed Berlin's \"unwavering support\" for Ukraine in its battle against the ongoing Russian invasion, and insisted that Kyiv can continue to rely on German backing.\n\"I am saying this very clearly to [Russian President Vladimir Putin here in Kyiv today: We have staying power. And we will stand by Ukraine for as long as necessary,\" Scholz said, speaking alongside Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\nArriving in the Ukrainian capital on a surprise visit on Monday morning, Scholz announced an additional €650 million ($685 million) worth of military aid, including including air defense systems, howitzers, combat and reconnaissance drones and supplies of artillery ammunition.\nScholz insisted that Russia not be allowed to impose a \"dictated peace\" on Ukraine in any potential negotiations to end the ongoing war.\n\"Putin should not think that, at some point, he'll only have Ukraine alone as an enemy,\" said Scholz, before addressing a warning to Moscow:\n\"There is no point carrying on. It will lead to nothing. Ukraine will remain independent; it will survive and it will stand.\"\nGerman military aid that will arrive in Ukraine in December includes IRIS-T air defense systems, Leopard 1 tanks and armed drones.\n\"Winter is just around the corner, so there will also be winter equipment, as well as hand-held weapons and warming devices,\" a German defense ministry spokesperson said just hours after Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Kyiv.\nThe ministry said that the deliveries were part of an aid package already announced by Berlin in October.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Kremlin said Monday that it had no \"expectations\" from German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to Ukraine.\n\"Germany is continuing its line of unconditional support to Ukraine,\" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said.\nScholz spoke by phone to Russian President Vladimir Putin last month.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUkraine must find diplomatic solutions to retake some of its occupied territory from Russia, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said in an interview with Japan's Kyodo News published on Monday.\nThe Ukrainian president said diplomacy could be an option \"only when we know that we are strong enough,\" he told the news agency.\nZelenskyy said US President-elect Donald Trump and his team were evaluating the Ukrainian \"victory plan\" and expected more talks with them to explain \"certain things in more detail.\"\nRussia is bringing Asia into the war in Ukraine with the use of Chinese-made drones and deployment of North Korean troops on Russian territory, German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said on Monday.\nBaerbock, who is in Beijing, stressed the responsibility of permanent members of the UN Security Council, which includes China, not to add fuel to conflicts.\n\"Drones from Chinese factories and North Korean troops attacking peace in the center of Europe violate our core European security interests,\" Baerbock said after meeting with her Chinese counterpart, Wang Yi.\nBaerbock told Wang that \"increasing Chinese support for Russia's war against Ukraine has an impact on our relations,\" according to a readout from Germany's foreign ministry.\n\"Core German and European security interests are affected,\" she said.\nBeijing says it is neutral over the war in Ukraine and it will not send lethal assistance to either side, unlike the United States and other Western nations.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz arrived in Kyiv for a surprise visit on Monday.\nIt is the first time Scholz has visited Ukraine in two and a half years.\n\"I traveled to Kyiv tonight: by train through a country that has been defending itself against the Russian war of aggression for over 1,000 days,\" Scholz said in a post on social media.\n\"I would like to make it clear here on the ground that Germany will remain Ukraine's strongest supporter in Europe.\"\nThe German leader will hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, as well as announce the delivery in December of further armaments worth €650 million ($685 million), German broadcaster ZDF cited Scholz as saying upon arrival.\nGermany's support for Ukraine comes as Europe's largest economy is in a state of political flux, with nationwide elections set to take place in 2025.\nNext year is also surrounded with uncertainty over the West's position on Ukraine, and in particular that of the United States, with Donald Trump due to assume the presidency at the end of January 2025.\nTrump has given mixed signals over his Ukraine policy and has previously said he could resolve the conflict, without explaining how.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\njsi/zc (AP, AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

US top diplomat Antony Blinken has also arrived in Jordan. Follow DW.\nHere are the latest developments from and regarding Syria on Thursday, December 12. This blog has now closed.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara to discuss the developments in Syria in the aftermath of the ouster of longtime dictator Bashar Assad.\nBlinken and Erdogan discussed the need for the international community to work together for the reconstruction of institutions in Syria, the Turkish presidency said in a statement.\nBlinken stressed the shared interest of the US and Turkey in supporting a Syrian-led political transition to an accountable and inclusive government, the US State Department said.\nThe discussions came as Turkish-backed rebels and US-backed forces clashed inside Syria.\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is the main ally in a US coalition against Islamic State militants.\nHowever, it is spearheaded by the People's Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara sees as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought the Turkish state for 40 years.\nBefore arriving in Ankara, Blinken said the PKK is an \"enduring threat\" to Turkey.\n\"At the same time ... we want to avoid sparking any kinds of additional conflicts inside of Syria at a time when we want to see this transition to an interim government and to a better way forward,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nJordan will host talks on Syria this weekend with foreign ministers from a number of Arab nations and Western countries, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nThe foreign ministers of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain and the Arab League chief are set to meet on Saturday in the Red Sea city of Aqaba to discuss ways to support a smooth transitional process in the war-torn country after the ouster of President Bashar Assad.\nAll the Arab ministers will also hold talks with their counterparts from Turkey and the United States as well as the European Union's foreign policy chief and the UN envoy for Syria.\nThe discussions will focus on \"ways of backing an inclusive political process led by the Syrians to achieve a transitional process,\" the ministry statement said.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Aqaba on Thursday, where the two discussed the future of Syria.\nThe two called for a \"secure\" Syria after the overthrow of strongman Bashar Assad.\nBlinken promised US support for \"the stability of Syria's neighbors, including Jordan, during this period of transition.\"\nBefore continuing his regional tour in Turkey — another key player in Syria — Blinken called for \"an inclusive transition that can lead to an accountable and representative Syrian government chosen by the Syrian people.\"\n\"When it comes to many actors who have real interests in Syria, it's also really important at this time that we all try to make sure that we're not sparking any additional conflicts,\" he added.\nReferencing an earlier conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in which Netanyahu said it was important to \"prevent terrorist activity\" in Syria, Blinken said Israel was trying to make sure \"the military equipment that's been abandoned by the Syrian army doesn't fall into the wrong hands -- terrorists, extremists, etcetera.\"\nA Jordanian palace statement said King Abdullah \"reaffirmed Jordan's respect\" for \"the Syrian people's choices, stressing the need to safeguard Syria's security and the safety of its citizens.\"\n     \nThe statement added that while discussing Syria, King Abdullah told Blinken that \"the first step to reach comprehensive regional calm is to end the Israeli war on Gaza.\"\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Thursday pitched a joint European approach to returning refugees to Syria.\n\"I believe it would be very expedient to organize this together,\" she said at a meeting of EU interior ministers in Brussels.\nNumerous EU countries froze asylum proceedings for Syrians when strongman Bashar Assad fled the country on Sunday.\nFaeser suggested EU nations exchange information on the latest developments in Syria in an effort to determine where it is heading.\nThe European Commission has warned against hasty deportations.\n\"We must now prepare the things that are necessary,\" retorted Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner.\n\"On the one hand, we need to suspend proceedings and then prepare for repatriations and deportations now. You can't wait, you have to work to make that clear,\" according to the Austrian.\nKarner said Vienna is \"not talking about the mass-deportations that some [on the far-right] want,\" but rather the targeted deportation of \"those who have become criminals, who do not share European and Austrian values, who don't want to work and who live off welfare.\"\nFaeser acknowledged Germany's own shortage of doctors and nurses Thursday, saying that those Syrians who would qualify for such jobs are \"welcome as long as they follow the law and work.\"\nSyria's acting government said that it had freed US citizen Travis Timmerman, who had seemingly been imprisoned under the regime of deposed Syrian leader Bashar Assad.\n\"The American...

    "content": "Former German Chancellor Angela Merkel and former US President Barack Obama were allies in office. But not from day one.\nBoth left office years ago, but they have left their mark on global politics. Angela Merkel was once the most powerful woman in the world, while Barack Obama was the world's most powerful person.\nIs there such a thing as friendship among sitting leaders whose primary responsibility is to serve the interests of their respective countries? Apparently so. Obama's presidency from 2009 to 2017 was framed, so to speak, by Merkel's 16 years as chancellor from 2005 to 2021, and a strong bond developed between the two. So much so that, toward the end of his term in office, Obama described Merkel as his closest ally.\nIt wasn't always that way. Many Germans rejoiced when Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, but Angela Merkel snubbed him in the summer of that year, while Obama was still only a candidate, by refusing to allow him to use the Brandenburg Gate as a backdrop for his speech during a visit to Berlin.\nObama had to relocate to the square in front of the Victory Column, where around 200,000 people greeted him in a scene reminiscent of John F. Kennedy's iconic visit to West Berlin in 1963.\nWith the Iraq war in 2003, George W. Bush had driven a wedge between the US and some European allies. Germany, then led by Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), was opposed to the war. Merkel, however, had sided with Bush as leader of the opposition.\nObama avoided Berlin in 2009, his first year in office, despite making two visits to Germany. This was interpreted as an affront, and relations between Merkel and Obama remained cool. There were concrete political reasons for this, most notably Germany's decision to abstain from the 2011 UN decision to take military action in the Libyan civil war.\nBut that was not the only reason. Even back then, Washington was urging its German ally to invest more in its defense and claiming that Germany's trade surplus was too high — rhetoric that escalated significantly under Donald Trump.\nYet despite — or perhaps because of — these disputes, Obama awarded Chancellor Merkel the Medal of Freedom in 2011, the highest honor that the US can bestow on a foreigner. Was it a gesture of reconciliation, an appeal for more responsibility? Commentators drew both conclusions at the time.\nIn 2013, Obama finally got his Berlin stage at the Brandenburg Gate. He and Merkel put their hands on each other's shoulders in a show of unity. However, tensions escalated again when the extent of the National Security Agency's spying on Germany was revealed.\nIn October of that year, it came to light that the NSA had even tapped the chancellor's cell phone. Merkel was furious and made what would become one of her most famous statements: \"Spying on friends, that's not acceptable.\" But there were no major political consequences.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe longer Merkel and Obama were in office, the more they seemed to grow closer politically and personally. Peter Beyer, a member of Merkel's conservative CDU party, once told DW that Obama especially admired Merkel's \"pragmatism, reliability, and professionalism.\"\nAs Germany's political and economic clout grew, he could no longer ignore the chancellor.\nThe G7 summit at Schloss Elmau in Bavaria in the summer of 2015 was the site of perhaps the most famous photo of the two: Obama sitting with outstretched arms on a bench, while Merkel appears to be explaining something to him, with the Alpine panorama behind her.\nPolitically, they had much in common. But how well did they complement each other? \"They are very different types,\" said Beyer. \"Obama is a brilliant orator, he reaches out to people. Merkel gets to the point in just a few words, she's not a great speaker, she doesn't sweep people away with enthusiasm.\" But both appreciated each other because they complemented each other.\nA few weeks after the G7 summit, Merkel decided not to close the German border to refugees. The step, which polarized Germany perhaps more than any other decision she made, was praised by Obama: Merkel had \"eloquently reminded us that we cannot turn our backs on our fellow human beings who are here now, and need our help now.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThen came Donald Trump in 2017. During the 2016 election campaign, the Republican called his Democratic rival Hillary Clinton \"America's Angela Merkel\" as a pejorative term, and claimed that Clinton also wanted to implement Merkel's \"crazy\" refugee policy in the US.\nWith the election of Trump, the US appeared to have changed from Germany's ally to its adversary in key policy areas: Free trade, climate protection, and how to deal with refugees.\nOn a meeting with Trump on March 17, 2017, Merkel wrote in her new memoir: \"We talked on two different levels. Trump on the emotional level, I on the factual level ... Whenever he did pay attention to my arguments, it was usually only in order to use them to make new accusations. He didn't seem to be interested in solving the problems I raised.\"\nIt is perhaps ironic that Merkel's book is being published just as Trump is about to take office for his second term — and it seems to be a show of defiance that Merkel wanted Obama to attend the US launch.\nObama's memoir, \"A Promised Land,\" was published four years ago, in November 2020. The thousand-page tome sold well around the world. Merkel's 700-page book, \"Freedom,\" will be published in more than 30 languages, and international interest appears to be high.\nShe plans to launch the English-language edition together with Obama at the Anthem Theater in Washington DC on December 2. Angela Merkel could not wish for a better publicity partner.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "In these politically difficult times, Germany is looking for partners in Latin America who are willing to seal the EU-Mercosur trade agreement. However, opposition has grown after 25 years of talks.\nWhen Olaf Scholz comes back to Germany from the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Wednesday, the crisis-ridden chancellor could be returning with something truly historic: a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur states of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. That is, if he can seal the deal after decades of negotiations.\n\"This free-trade agreement would be liberating for the German economy. It's almost impossible to imagine a more difficult situation geopolitically — we have to use this opportunity,\" Volker Treier, the foreign policy leader of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told DW.\n\"Right now the window is open — you can't negotiate for 25 years, not have a deal, and still believe you can just keep stretching it out like chewing gum,\" Treier said. \"If not now, when?\"\nTreier noted a recent business survey from the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Brussels. The result, he said, was \"pretty dismal.\"\nWith the European Union facing US protectionism under the incoming Trump administration, Treier said, an agreement with Mercosur would be an important signal for EU and German businesses. When it comes to batteries, solar panels, wind energy and green hydrogen, he said, the European Union could achieve its green transformation more quickly and sustainably with the help of raw materials from Latin America.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn return, European businesses would no longer pay €4 billion ($4.2 billion) in tariffs to export their goods to Mercosur countries, according to Treier. \"We already have good relations with Mercosur, but there's no real dynamism. In part, that is because Mercosur countries are imposing 25-30% tariffs on classic German export products like cars, but also electronics or machined goods,\" said Treier.\nKaja Kallas, the EU's incoming foreign affairs chief, echoed those sentiments. \"If we don't do a trade agreement with them, then this void will be filled by China,\" she said during her confirmation hearing before the European Parliament this week. China has increased its investment in the region by a factor of 34 between 2020 and 2022, and the first Chinese-controlled mega-port in South America has just opened for business in Chancay, Peru.\nIn the event the agreement isn't signed at the G20, proponents are aiming to get it wrapped up at the Mercosur summit taking place in Montevideo, Uruguay, in early December.\nAt the same time, opposition to the deal is also gaining momentum in Europe and South America — and it's not just coming from environmentalists. European farmers are livid, criticizing double standards and unfair competition with their South American colleagues.\nIn an appeal printed in the French daily newspaper Le Monde, some 600 French parliamentarians called for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to refrain from signing the agreement. Moreover, and potentially more ominously, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has said Paris would not agree to the deal in its current form.\n\"The agreement between Mercosur and the EU is far more advantageous to Europe than it is to South America,\" as Raul Montenegro, an Argentine biologist and 2004 Right Livelihood Award winner, told DW. \"The main losers in an eventual agreement will definitely be biological diversity in South America, as well as the small and midsized businesses and poor in both regions.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nG20 host Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who hopes to enshrine the fight against hunger and climate change in the Rio summit's final communique, is facing a herculean task when it comes to the endless discussion of free-trade agreements, yet remains upbeat.\n\"I have never been so optimistic about the EU-Mercosur,\" the Brazilian president said on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September. Lula is determined to heave Brazil into the role of a global player in his third and likely last term in office.\nThat is yet another reason that Treier of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry said time is fleeting.\n\"Self-confidence is increasing among the Mercosur countries, the same way it is across the Global South. We were in India two-and-a-half weeks ago for our Asia conference and the same thing is happening there: They are still willing to reach out to us, but things won't stay that way forever,\" he said.\nThis article was originally written in German."

For the latest developments regarding the Russian war in Ukraine, please click here.\nBelow, you can read a roundup of the developments as they happened on Monday, November 18:\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Monday hailed Washington's decision to allow Ukraine to fire US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia.\n\"It was a decision that was a totally good one,\" Macron said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil. US President Joe Biden, who made the policy change, is also present at the summit.\nMacron acknowledged that the policy change was triggered by North Korea sending troops to aid Russia in its war in Ukraine, a move from Moscow that was \"a grave change in the conflict which shouldn't be underestimated,\" the French president said.\nHe added that Russia was \"the only power making an escalation in this conflict today\" with the North Korean mobilization. \"So it's really a sudden change in this war that led to the Americans' decision.\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was asked at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on Monday about the supply of German long-range missiles to Ukraine.\nIn Germany's case, Taurus cruise missiles would be the relevant weaponry, something Berlin has not sent to Ukraine.\n\"I have explained very clearly why I do not think it is right to supply Taurus cruise missiles,\" Scholz said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil.\nHe said it was important to support Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion while still acting \"prudently.\"\nThe missiles could only be used if \"responsibility for targeting\" was shared, Scholz said, a move he has previously said would risk the perception of direct German participation in the war.\n\"That is something that I cannot take responsibility for,\" Scholz said Monday in Rio de Janeiro. \"We have a clear understanding that the powerful weapons we have supplied so far, the long-range artillery, the rocket launchers, cannot be used to penetrate deep into the Russian hinterland.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWith snap elections looming in Germany, Scholz also faces a weakened situation domestically and the risk of further damage to the upcoming campaign, with a strong pacifist tradition in postwar Germany that was often particularly prevalent in what his Social Democrats would consider their supporter base, for instance the major trade unions.\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza believes it is \"counterproductive to engage in any sort of business as usual with Vladimir Putin\" and that the \"only strategic solution [to Russian aggression] is to have a change of government in Russia.\"\nSpeaking to DW at the protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, Kara-Murza criticized the decision by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone on Friday and any suggestion of cutting a deal with the Kremlin.\n\"We hear such voices in the West … voices [which] claim that this is a road to peace,\" he said. \"They couldn't be more wrong on this. If there is some sort of a deal that is cut with Putin over the head of Ukraine without taking in consideration the interests of Ukraine, this will not lead to peace.\"\nFor Kara-Murza, a former ally of murdered Russian dissident Boris Nemtsov and vice-chairman of the now-outlawed NGO Open Russia, regime change in Moscow is the only option.\n\"Only when Russia has a democratically elected, legitimate government that respects the rights and freedoms of its own people, [will it] also respect the civilized norms of international behavior,\" he said.\n\"Only then will Russia stop being a threat both to itself and to the outside world.\"\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza has described the recent phone call between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"symbolic\" — and not in a good way.\n\"History has shown very clearly what the appeasement of dictators leads to,\" he told DW during an anti-Putin protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, pointing out that Russia conducted one of its largest bombardments of Ukrainian cities just two days later.\nKara-Murza, who was released from Russian jail as part of the majorprisoner swap in August this year, compared the West's attempts to deal with Putin's Russia over the last 20 years to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s.\n\"What is seen as compromise by the leaders of democratic nations is seen as weakness by dictators,\" he said.\n\"This policy of Western appeasement towards Putin was in a large part responsible for the war of aggression that Putin unleashed in Ukraine, because appeasement of dictators always leads to more aggression.\"\nUS President Joe Biden has urged the leaders of G20 countries to support Ukraine’s sovereignty.\n\"The United States strongly supports Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should as well,\" Biden said in his opening remarks at his final G20 summit.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is also attending the summit that is taking place in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe comment comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemingly appeared to confirm US media reports that the White House had quietly lifted its ban on Kyiv using US-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russian territory.\nBiden and his government are yet to publicly confirm this.\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the relaxation of restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine by the US is \"astonishly dangerous.\"\nHe urged against NATO member states allowing their weapons to be used inside Russian territory.\nAlthough Hungary is a member of both the EU and NATO, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has caused outrage amongst allies for being friendly to Moscow in recent years, going so far as to visit Russia in July for talks with President Vladimir Putin.\nDW spoke with retired US Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, the former commander of the US Army in Europe, about the change in US policy.\n\"This will enable Ukraine to strike Russian and North Korean headquarters, logistics and artillery that will help disrupt Russian preparations for their attack... that'll be the immediate tactical benefit which will undermine the Russian advantage,\" he said, adding that the move \"significantly degrades Russia's ability to continue its meat grinder tactics.\"\nHodges said that the decision also \"increases pressure on Germany to reconsider its very restrictive policy about Taurus.\"\n\"This tells the Russians that the United States we are not turning our back on Ukraine and that their hope that we would just quit is going to fail.\"\nYou can watch the full interview here.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe office of Chancellor Scholz has said that despite support for the US decision from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Germany had not changed its mind about delivering long-range missiles to Ukraine.\n\"The chancellor's decision is unchanged,\" a spokesman said when asked about sending German Taurus missiles to Kyiv.\nBerlin's position has long been that such a move would draw Germany too deep into the conflict.\nThe European Union has announced that it is widening sanctions against the government in Tehran over its support for the Russian military.\nAt a foreign ministers meeting, the bloc decided to prohibit any transactions with ports \"used for the transfer of Iranian UAVs or missiles or related technology and components to Russia.\"\nIran-made ballistic missiles are a key component of Russia's war in Ukraine.\nGermany's top diplomat Annalena Baerbock said that backing Moscow \"must and will have consequences\" for Beijing, as doing so is a threat to Europe's \"core security interests.\"\nShe did not give further details on what the consequences for China's alleged funneling of spy drones to Russia might be, but said the European Union was preparing fresh sanctions on Iran for giving the Kremlin ballistic missiles.\nAn unnamed EU official told German news agency DPA that reports of direct Chinese military aid were \"extremely worrying,\" but that there was no hard evidence of it yet.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Joe Biden was further inflaming tensions with his decision to allow Kyiv to use American long-range weapons in Russia.\n\"It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions,\" he said.\nEuropean leaders have expressed their support for the call from Washington to drop restrictions on Ukraine using long-range missiles supplied by Western allies inside Russia.\n\"The decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasize that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ahead of a summit for EU top diplomats in Brussels.\nHer French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot echoed her sentiments, saying \"we openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory.

    "content": "Chancellor Olaf Scholz has expressed frustration over a lack of clarity on Russia's responsibility for the war in Ukraine and Hamas's for the conflict in the Middle East.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz on Tuesday slammed the final communique delivered at the Group of 20 industrialized nations, or G20, summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.\n\"It is too little when the G20 cannot find the words to make it clear Russia is responsible [for the war in Ukraine]. It's not what I would have liked,\" he said.\nPointing to the grim anniversary that the day brought, Scholz railed against fellow G20 leader, Russian President Vladimir Putin, \"1,000 days in which people have had to suffer for his blind megalomania, for his scheme to enlarge his territory simply through violence.\"\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron meanwhile urged Russian President Vladimir Putin to \"listen to reason\" at the summit, at a relatively rare event still involving senior Russian representation in Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov.\n\"I truly want to call on Russia to listen to reason here. As a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council it has responsibilities,\" he said, accusing Russia of becoming, \"a force for global destabilization.\"\nDuring a bilateral meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping — a key ally of Putin's — Macron told reporters he had urged his Chinese counterpart to \"use all his influence\" to push the Russians toward de-escalation.\nXi has \"the capacity to negotiate with President Putin so that he halts his attacks\" on Ukraine and reconsiders his new nuclear stance, said Macron.\nThe French president said he also broached neighboring North Korea's decision to support Putin's invasion during his talks with Xi.\nDespite his dissatisfaction with the final communique's comments on Ukraine, German Chancellor Scholz defended his own prior decision to withhold delivery of longer-distance missiles to Kyiv, saying it was the right choice.\nScholz pointed out that Germany is and will remain Ukraine's biggest individual supporter in Europe. At the same time, he underscored what he said was the importance of \"acting with prudence.\"\nScholz said he opposed delivering long-range missiles early on and that he was right to do so as this would have forced German troops to get involved in target selection deep inside Russia, saying, \"I don't think it would be right\" to participate in the conflict like that.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAlthough he appreciated G20 calls for a cease-fire in Gaza, Scholz said he \"regretted\" that the communique did not address Israel's right to defend itself in the face of threats from Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran as the conflict in the Middle East continues to spread. He was also unhappy that the paper failed to place blame for the spread of the conflict on the militant Islamist group Hamas.\n\"I very much regret that there was no consensus. It would have done the situation good if we had said: everything started with a horrific and brutal terrorist attack on Israel.\"\nThe US, EU, Japan and several other nations have named Hamas a terrorist organization.\nUltimately, said Scholz, \"it is becoming clear how much geopolitical tensions are also having an impact on the G20… The wind blowing in international relations is getting harsher.\"\nThe leaders' declaration included several aspects based on the priorities of the Brazilian presidency of the group, such as the fight against hunger and climate change as well as reform of global governance.\nIt reaffirmed the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5 C and called for a substantial \"scaling up of climate finance from billions to trillions from all sources\" to support the transition to green energy.\nUS President Joe Biden used the final day of talks to announce hundreds of millions of dollars in new climate and development pledges.\nThe G20 also stated an intent to make the UN Security Council more representative.\njs/rt (AFP, Reuters, AP)"

Follow DW.\nHere are the latest developments from and regarding Syria on Thursday, December 12. This blog has now closed.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan in Ankara to discuss the developments in Syria in the aftermath of the ouster of longtime dictator Bashar Assad.\nBlinken and Erdogan discussed the need for the international community to work together for the reconstruction of institutions in Syria, the Turkish presidency said in a statement.\nBlinken stressed the shared interest of the US and Turkey in supporting a Syrian-led political transition to an accountable and inclusive government, the US State Department said.\nThe discussions came as Turkish-backed rebels and US-backed forces clashed inside Syria.\nThe Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) is the main ally in a US coalition against Islamic State militants.\nHowever, it is spearheaded by the People's Protection Units (YPG), which Ankara sees as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) militants who have fought the Turkish state for 40 years.\nBefore arriving in Ankara, Blinken said the PKK is an \"enduring threat\" to Turkey.\n\"At the same time ... we want to avoid sparking any kinds of additional conflicts inside of Syria at a time when we want to see this transition to an interim government and to a better way forward,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nJordan will host talks on Syria this weekend with foreign ministers from a number of Arab nations and Western countries, the Jordanian Foreign Ministry said in a statement.\nThe foreign ministers of Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Bahrain and the Arab League chief are set to meet on Saturday in the Red Sea city of Aqaba to discuss ways to support a smooth transitional process in the war-torn country after the ouster of President Bashar Assad.\nAll the Arab ministers will also hold talks with their counterparts from Turkey and the United States as well as the European Union's foreign policy chief and the UN envoy for Syria.\nThe discussions will focus on \"ways of backing an inclusive political process led by the Syrians to achieve a transitional process,\" the ministry statement said.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken met with Jordan's King Abdullah II in Aqaba on Thursday, where the two discussed the future of Syria.\nThe two called for a \"secure\" Syria after the overthrow of strongman Bashar Assad.\nBlinken promised US support for \"the stability of Syria's neighbors, including Jordan, during this period of transition.\"\nBefore continuing his regional tour in Turkey — another key player in Syria — Blinken called for \"an inclusive transition that can lead to an accountable and representative Syrian government chosen by the Syrian people.\"\n\"When it comes to many actors who have real interests in Syria, it's also really important at this time that we all try to make sure that we're not sparking any additional conflicts,\" he added.\nReferencing an earlier conversation between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and US National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan in which Netanyahu said it was important to \"prevent terrorist activity\" in Syria, Blinken said Israel was trying to make sure \"the military equipment that's been abandoned by the Syrian army doesn't fall into the wrong hands -- terrorists, extremists, etcetera.\"\nA Jordanian palace statement said King Abdullah \"reaffirmed Jordan's respect\" for \"the Syrian people's choices, stressing the need to safeguard Syria's security and the safety of its citizens.\"\n     \nThe statement added that while discussing Syria, King Abdullah told Blinken that \"the first step to reach comprehensive regional calm is to end the Israeli war on Gaza.\"\nGerman Interior Minister Nancy Faeser on Thursday pitched a joint European approach to returning refugees to Syria.\n\"I believe it would be very expedient to organize this together,\" she said at a meeting of EU interior ministers in Brussels.\nNumerous EU countries froze asylum proceedings for Syrians when strongman Bashar Assad fled the country on Sunday.\nFaeser suggested EU nations exchange information on the latest developments in Syria in an effort to determine where it is heading.\nThe European Commission has warned against hasty deportations.\n\"We must now prepare the things that are necessary,\" retorted Austrian Interior Minister Gerhard Karner.\n\"On the one hand, we need to suspend proceedings and then prepare for repatriations and deportations now. You can't wait, you have to work to make that clear,\" according to the Austrian.\nKarner said Vienna is \"not talking about the mass-deportations that some [on the far-right] want,\" but rather the targeted deportation of \"those who have become criminals, who do not share European and Austrian values, who don't want to work and who live off welfare.\"\nFaeser acknowledged Germany's own shortage of doctors and nurses Thursday, saying that those Syrians who would qualify for such jobs are \"welcome as long as they follow the law and work.\"\nSyria's acting government said that it had freed US citizen Travis Timmerman, who had seemingly been imprisoned under the regime of deposed Syrian leader Bashar Assad.\n\"The American... Travis Timmerman has been released and secured,\" said the interim government's department of political affairs on the Telegram messaging service.\n\"We confirm our readiness to cooperate directly with the US administration to search for American citizens disappeared by the former Assad regime.\"\nTimmerman told the CBS broadcaster that he was detained for several months after irregularly entering Syria from Lebanon, saying that he had wanted to visit the country for \"spiritual purposes\" as a Christian pilgrim.\nUS Secretary of State Antony Blinken said that Washington was working to \"bring home\" the released American.\nHe said that he had no update on the status of US journalist Austin Tice, who was abducted in Syria in 2012, but that Wasington was still working to find him.\nSyrian rebels have released thousands from the Assad regime's notorious prisons following the former leader's ouster.\nSyria's new government plans to suspend the country's constitution and parliament for a three-month transition period, government spokesperson Obaida Arnaout told France's AFP news agency.\nThe Reuters news agency also reported the planned suspension citing an unnamed government source.\n\"A judicial and human rights committee will be established to examine the constitution and then introduce amendments,\" Arnaout said.\n\"We respect religious and cultural diversity and Syria,\" Arnaout stressed.\nArnaout pledged that Syria's interim administration will establish \"the rule of law.\"\n\"All those who committed crimes against the Syrian people will be judged in accordance with the law,\" he said.\nRebels led by the Islamist Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) overthrew Bashar Assad's regime on Sunday.\nSyria's current constitution was adopted in 2012 and does not specify a state religion.\nA majority of Syria's population are Sunni Muslims, while the Assad family belongs to the largest minority, the Alawite subgroup of Shiite Muslims.

For the latest developments regarding the Russian war in Ukraine, please click here.\nBelow, you can read a roundup of the developments as they happened on Monday, November 18:\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron on Monday hailed Washington's decision to allow Ukraine to fire US-supplied long-range missiles into Russia.\n\"It was a decision that was a totally good one,\" Macron said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil. US President Joe Biden, who made the policy change, is also present at the summit.\nMacron acknowledged that the policy change was triggered by North Korea sending troops to aid Russia in its war in Ukraine, a move from Moscow that was \"a grave change in the conflict which shouldn't be underestimated,\" the French president said.\nHe added that Russia was \"the only power making an escalation in this conflict today\" with the North Korean mobilization. \"So it's really a sudden change in this war that led to the Americans' decision.\"\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz was asked at the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro on Monday about the supply of German long-range missiles to Ukraine.\nIn Germany's case, Taurus cruise missiles would be the relevant weaponry, something Berlin has not sent to Ukraine.\n\"I have explained very clearly why I do not think it is right to supply Taurus cruise missiles,\" Scholz said on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Brazil.\nHe said it was important to support Ukraine's defense against Russia's full-scale invasion while still acting \"prudently.\"\nThe missiles could only be used if \"responsibility for targeting\" was shared, Scholz said, a move he has previously said would risk the perception of direct German participation in the war.\n\"That is something that I cannot take responsibility for,\" Scholz said Monday in Rio de Janeiro. \"We have a clear understanding that the powerful weapons we have supplied so far, the long-range artillery, the rocket launchers, cannot be used to penetrate deep into the Russian hinterland.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWith snap elections looming in Germany, Scholz also faces a weakened situation domestically and the risk of further damage to the upcoming campaign, with a strong pacifist tradition in postwar Germany that was often particularly prevalent in what his Social Democrats would consider their supporter base, for instance the major trade unions.\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza believes it is \"counterproductive to engage in any sort of business as usual with Vladimir Putin\" and that the \"only strategic solution [to Russian aggression] is to have a change of government in Russia.\"\nSpeaking to DW at the protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, Kara-Murza criticized the decision by German Chancellor Olaf Scholz to speak to Russian President Vladimir Putin on the phone on Friday and any suggestion of cutting a deal with the Kremlin.\n\"We hear such voices in the West … voices [which] claim that this is a road to peace,\" he said. \"They couldn't be more wrong on this. If there is some sort of a deal that is cut with Putin over the head of Ukraine without taking in consideration the interests of Ukraine, this will not lead to peace.\"\nFor Kara-Murza, a former ally of murdered Russian dissident Boris Nemtsov and vice-chairman of the now-outlawed NGO Open Russia, regime change in Moscow is the only option.\n\"Only when Russia has a democratically elected, legitimate government that respects the rights and freedoms of its own people, [will it] also respect the civilized norms of international behavior,\" he said.\n\"Only then will Russia stop being a threat both to itself and to the outside world.\"\nRussian opposition activist Vladimir Kara-Murza has described the recent phone call between German Chancellor Olaf Scholz and Russian President Vladimir Putin as \"symbolic\" — and not in a good way.\n\"History has shown very clearly what the appeasement of dictators leads to,\" he told DW during an anti-Putin protest staged by exiled Russians in Berlin on Sunday, pointing out that Russia conducted one of its largest bombardments of Ukrainian cities just two days later.\nKara-Murza, who was released from Russian jail as part of the majorprisoner swap in August this year, compared the West's attempts to deal with Putin's Russia over the last 20 years to the appeasement of Adolf Hitler and the Nazis in Germany in the 1930s.\n\"What is seen as compromise by the leaders of democratic nations is seen as weakness by dictators,\" he said.\n\"This policy of Western appeasement towards Putin was in a large part responsible for the war of aggression that Putin unleashed in Ukraine, because appeasement of dictators always leads to more aggression.\"\nUS President Joe Biden has urged the leaders of G20 countries to support Ukraine’s sovereignty.\n\"The United States strongly supports Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity. Everyone around this table in my view should as well,\" Biden said in his opening remarks at his final G20 summit.\nRussian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov is also attending the summit that is taking place in Rio de Janeiro.\nThe comment comes after Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy seemingly appeared to confirm US media reports that the White House had quietly lifted its ban on Kyiv using US-made long-range weapons to strike inside Russian territory.\nBiden and his government are yet to publicly confirm this.\nHungarian Foreign Minister Peter Szijjarto called the relaxation of restrictions on weapons sent to Ukraine by the US is \"astonishly dangerous.\"\nHe urged against NATO member states allowing their weapons to be used inside Russian territory.\nAlthough Hungary is a member of both the EU and NATO, Prime Minister Viktor Orban has caused outrage amongst allies for being friendly to Moscow in recent years, going so far as to visit Russia in July for talks with President Vladimir Putin.\nDW spoke with retired US Army Lieutenant General Ben Hodges, the former commander of the US Army in Europe, about the change in US policy.\n\"This will enable Ukraine to strike Russian and North Korean headquarters, logistics and artillery that will help disrupt Russian preparations for their attack... that'll be the immediate tactical benefit which will undermine the Russian advantage,\" he said, adding that the move \"significantly degrades Russia's ability to continue its meat grinder tactics.\"\nHodges said that the decision also \"increases pressure on Germany to reconsider its very restrictive policy about Taurus.\"\n\"This tells the Russians that the United States we are not turning our back on Ukraine and that their hope that we would just quit is going to fail.\"\nYou can watch the full interview here.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe office of Chancellor Scholz has said that despite support for the US decision from Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock, Germany had not changed its mind about delivering long-range missiles to Ukraine.\n\"The chancellor's decision is unchanged,\" a spokesman said when asked about sending German Taurus missiles to Kyiv.\nBerlin's position has long been that such a move would draw Germany too deep into the conflict.\nThe European Union has announced that it is widening sanctions against the government in Tehran over its support for the Russian military.\nAt a foreign ministers meeting, the bloc decided to prohibit any transactions with ports \"used for the transfer of Iranian UAVs or missiles or related technology and components to Russia.\"\nIran-made ballistic missiles are a key component of Russia's war in Ukraine.\nGermany's top diplomat Annalena Baerbock said that backing Moscow \"must and will have consequences\" for Beijing, as doing so is a threat to Europe's \"core security interests.\"\nShe did not give further details on what the consequences for China's alleged funneling of spy drones to Russia might be, but said the European Union was preparing fresh sanctions on Iran for giving the Kremlin ballistic missiles.\nAn unnamed EU official told German news agency DPA that reports of direct Chinese military aid were \"extremely worrying,\" but that there was no hard evidence of it yet.\nKremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said that President Joe Biden was further inflaming tensions with his decision to allow Kyiv to use American long-range weapons in Russia.\n\"It's obvious that the outgoing administration in Washington intends to take steps in order to continue fuelling the fire and provoking further escalation of tensions,\" he said.\nEuropean leaders have expressed their support for the call from Washington to drop restrictions on Ukraine using long-range missiles supplied by Western allies inside Russia.\n\"The decision from the American side, and I would like to emphasize that this is not a rethink but an intensification of what has already been delivered by other partners, is so important at this moment,\" German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said ahead of a summit for EU top diplomats in Brussels.\nHer French counterpart Jean-Noel Barrot echoed her sentiments, saying \"we openly said this was an option that we would consider if it was to allow to strike a target from where Russia is currently aggressing Ukrainian territory. So nothing new on the other side.\"\nOutgoing EU foreign policy chief Josep Borrell added:  \"I've been saying once and again that Ukraine should be able to use the arms we provided to them, in order to not only stop the arrows but also to be able to hit the archers.\"\n\"I continue believing this is what has to be done.

As always, the Hungarian side did not warn (us) about its contacts with Moscow.\"\nOrban, who is known for his overtures to Russian strongman Vladimir Putin, had said he was on a self-proclaimed \"peace mission.\" Orban has repeatedly faced criticism for bucking EU policy by blocking aid to embattled Kyiv after it was invaded by Russia in February 2022.\nZelenskyy blasted Orban, posting on the social media platform X that, \"No one should boost (their) personal image at the expense of unity.\"\nRussia has claimed no peaceful solution to the conflict is possible, saying Ukraine is not interested in a deal.\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz says Ukraine's course of European integration cannot be reversed, adding that Russian President Vladimir Putin had not achieved a single war goal.\nSpeaking at a German-Ukrainian economic forum, Scholz added that a large amount of private investment was needed for Ukraine's energy sector.\nThe chancellor also has called for German companies to invest more in the Ukrainian armaments and energy sector.\n\"If you invest in Ukraine today and in the coming years, you are investing in a future EU member,\" said Scholz.\n\"In the defense industry, there are initial joint ventures and some initial settlements — I think that this should continue dynamically.\n\"Ukraine will get through the winter,\" said the chancellor, referring to the ongoing Russian attacks on civilian infrastructure such as power plants.\nScholz also pointed out that Germany has already delivered five Iris-T SLM systems, three Patriot systems and over 50 Gepard anti-aircraft tanks to defend Ukraine against Russian attacks.\nRussia says it is not ready to make concessions when it comes to Ukraine and that President Vladimir Putin's own proposals on how to end the conflict must be implemented.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova commented after being asked about a call on Sunday by US President-elect Donald Trump for an immediate cease-fire.\nTrump urged negotiations between Ukraine and Russia to end \"the madness.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who has been pushing hard for his country to be able to join the NATO military alliance, responded to Trump's comments by saying Kyiv needed effective security guarantees.\nZakharova said that anyone who thought Russia would make concessions either had a short memory or did not have enough knowledge of the subject.\nPutin's proposals are that Ukraine must not join NATO and that Russia needs the entire territory of the four Ukrainian regions he has declared are now part of Russia.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRussia says it has recaptured two villages from Ukraine in the border region of Kursk, where Kyiv's forces launched a major ground assault in August.\nRussian army units \"liberated the settlements of Darino and Plyokhovo during the course of offensive operations\", the Russian Defense Ministry said.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin and Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban have discussed the Ukraine conflict in a call.\n\"There was a thorough exchange of views on Ukrainian issues,\" the Kremlin said in its readout of the conversation on Wednesday, adding that Putin said Kyiv's position was \"destructive,\" ruling out a peace agreement.\nThe call was initiated at Orban's request, with the Hungarian leader seeking to cast himself as a possible peacemaker.\n\"Viktor Orban expressed interest in assisting the joint search for political-diplomatic paths to resolve the crisis,\" the Kremlin said.\nThe pair's discussion came a day after Budapest's top diplomat said Hungary would press ahead with its self-styled Ukraine \"peace mission.\"\nOrban met US President-elect Donald Trump at his Florida estate earlier this week. Trump has vowed to secure a peace deal within hours of coming to office in January.\nThe Hungarian leader is the closest political partner of both Trump and Putin in the European Union.\nHe angered fellow EU leaders in July by carrying out breakaway diplomacy with Russia to explore a path to ending the conflict.\nThe Kremlin said Orban and Putin also discussed energy projects, with Budapest remaining a major consumer of Russian energy.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nChancellor Olaf Scholz is among those set to speak at the German-Ukrainian Economic Forum in Berlin, where the focus will be on Ukraine's economic resilience.\nFrom the German side,  Economy Minister Robert Habeck and Development Minister Svenja Schulze are also expected to attend.\nUkraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal, Deputy Prime Minister Yulia Svyrydenko and Energy Minister Herman Halushchenko are also expected to join.\nOrganizers say special attention will be given to Ukraine's energy supply as well as cooperation between German and Ukrainian arms companies.\nThe gathering comes nearly three years into the full-scale Russian invasion of the country, and with Ukraine once again facing a winter of power shortages amid Russia's relentless attacks on its energy infrastructure.\nIn 2023, Germany exported goods worth €6.9 billion ($8.8 billion) to Ukraine, while it imported goods worth €2.9 billion.\nImports from Ukraine mainly included agricultural products, automotive parts and food.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nUS President-elect Donald Trump has said solving the Ukraine crisis would be his leading foreign priority once he assumes office next month.\n\"I think we have to solve the Ukraine problem with Russia,\" the US president-elect told French magazine Paris Match in an interview released on Wednesday.\n\"Both those countries are losing numbers that nobody can believe. Hundreds of thousands of soldiers are being killed,\" Trump said in the interview carried out on Saturday.\nHis comments came in response to a question about his top priority on the international stage.\nMeanwhile, Trump described the Middle East as a \"less difficult situation.\"\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has responded to a call by Trump for an \"immediate cease-fire\" and peace talks in Ukraine by saying that his country needed \"effective guarantees\" for a peace that was secured from further Russian aggression.\nZelenskyy made his comments after three-way talks with Trump hosted by French President Emmanuel Macron at the Elysee Palace in Paris.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nrc/rm (AFP, AP, dpa, Reuters)"

    "content": "Recent advances by a coalition of rebel groups led to the abrupt toppling of long-time Syrian dictator Bashar Assad. Here's a look at the different opposition actors and political powers involved.\nSyria's civil war has reached a pivotal moment with the fall of President Bashar Assad, bringing an end to his decades-long rule marked by corruption, repression and foreign intervention. A coalition of opposition forces has broken a prolonged stalemate, dramatically altering the course of the conflict.\nHowever, the Syrian opposition remains a fragmented patchwork of groups with conflicting ideologies and clashing long-term ambitions. Each group is dependent on the support of competing foreign powers, often putting them at odds with one another.\nHere's a closer look at the players shaping the post-Assad landscape in Syria.\nThe recent lightning offensive that led to the fall of Damascus was spearheaded by Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), an Islamist militant group led by Abu Mohammed al-Golani, whose real name is Ahmad al-Sharaa.\nHTS has a complex history rooted in the Syrian conflict. Initially established as Jabhat al-Nusra in 2011, the group was an al-Qaeda affiliate founded with involvement from Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the key jihadi leader who later headed Islamic State (IS).\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nKnown for its jihadi ideology, Jabhat al-Nusra often clashed with other opposition groups, including the main rebel coalition under the Free Syria banner. In 2016, al-Golani severed ties with al-Qaeda and rebranded the group as HTS, later merging it with several smaller Islamist factions.\nWhile HTS' ideology remains largely aligned with al-Qaeda, the group has shifted its focus to establishing fundamentalist Islamic rule within Syria, distancing itself from IS' broader ambitions of a global caliphate.\nHTS has since cemented its power base in the northwestern province of Idlib, where it acts as the de facto administration. However, allegations of human rights abuses have undermined its efforts to gain broader legitimacy.\nHTS is designated a terrorist organization by the UN, the US, Turkey and others. However, the group's recent offensive appears to align with Ankara's long-standing goal of ousting Assad, and likely could not have taken place without Turkey's coordination and support, despite Turkish officials denying direct involvement.\nIn addition to HTS, many other Syrian militias are fighting with their own agendas and allegiances.\nOne major coalition group taking part in the offensive on Aleppo is the Syrian National Army (SNA), an umbrella group established in 2017 that brings together dozens of factions with varying ideologies.\nIn contrast to the more centralized and cohesive Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, the SNA is a fragmented coalition of disparate armed groups. Many previously operated under the Free Syrian Army, and have often clashed among themselves.\nDespite its internal divisions, many SNA factions maintain strong ties to Turkey. Some, such as the Sultan Suleiman Shah Brigade, the al-Hamza Division, and the Sultan Murad Brigade, are closely aligned with Ankara, reflecting their Turkish backing through names honoring Ottoman figures.\nHowever, not all SNA factions align fully with Turkish interests. Certain groups, while cooperating with Ankara, seek to balance their own priorities. For instance, the coalition includes influential rebel factions like Ahrar al-Sham, whose stated goals are to \"overthrow the Assad regime\" and \"establish an Islamic state governed by Sharia law.\"\nIn the past few days, SNA forces have clashed with Kurdish forces in northern provinces and taken several strategic towns and villages. This move is aligned with one of Turkey's main goals in Syria: preventing the presence of a powerful Kurdish military and organizations along Turkish-Syrian border.\nThe Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) are a coalition of primarily Kurdish fighters, alongside Arabs and other ethnic groups, that have emerged during Syria's civil war.\nFormed in 2015, the SDF operates under the leadership of the Kurdish People's Protection Units (YPG) and has received significant support from the US, particularly in the campaign against \"Islamic State.\"\nAfter \"Islamic State\" was largely defeated, the Kurdish-led forces consolidated control over towns in the northeast, expanding an autonomous region they had built there.\nHowever, Kurdish fighters still contend with their longtime enemy, Turkey, which sees them as an extension of a Kurdish separatist insurgency and the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK).\nLike other regional powers, Turkey has exerted its influence in Syria by backing armed groups such as HTS and SNA. Since the beginning of the civil war, the Turkish military has launched several military interventions across the border into Syria, mostly against Syrian Kurdish-led forces.\nIts latest operation dates back to October 2019, with Ankara's goal being to push Kurdish fighters at least 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) away from its border and establish a so-called \"safe zone\" in parts of Syria that it plans to send refugees.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSince then, Turkey has effectively controlled a zone along Syria's northern border, enabling it to begin coordinating with anti-Assad rebel groups.\nRussia has been Assad's most reliable ally, providing military and logistical support throughout the war. Moscow's airstrikes and troops helped Assad maintain power for years, but its capacity to intervene has diminished as resources have been diverted to the war in Ukraine.\nIran views Syria as a vital link in its \"axis of resistance,\" a coalition of militias in the Middle East that fight against US influence and Israel. It has supported Assad by deploying Iranian forces and Hezbollah militants as Damascus allowed the flow of weapons from Iran and Iraq into Lebanon.\nHowever, recent reports have suggested Iran is pulling back its personnel, indicating challenges in maintaining its role amid Assad's fall.\nThe US initially supported opposition groups during the early stages of the uprising in the 2010s, later shifting focus to fighting \"Islamic State.\"\nToday, about 900 US troops remain in Syria, primarily in Kurdish-controlled areas and oil-rich regions in the northeast, as well as at a military outpost in the border zone between Syria, Iraq and Jordan.\nOver the past decade, Israel has routinely targeted Iranian and Hezbollah assets in Syria through frequent airstrikes. Its actions aim to disrupt weapons transfers to Hezbollah and neutralize threats near the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights.\nRecently, Israeli forces moved into Quneitra, a border town near the Golan Heights, as militant groups gained control of surrounding areas. The Israeli military has declared new military zones in the Golan Heights along the border with Syria.\nEdited by: Helen Whittle"

But analysts fear that clashes between soldiers and protesters might make the unrest even more dangerous.\n\"If things turn violent then there will be a possibility of direct military intervention that will further deteriorate the situation,\" political commentator Zahid Husain told DW.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"If the army is going to crush the protesters then the situation will be beyond their control,\" he warned.\nLegal expert Osama Malik told DW that an outright military intervention was \"unlikely.\"\n\"However, if army officers are killed in clashes with this armed horde, then all bets are off,\" he added.\nMaleeha Lodhi, a former ambassador to the US, the UK and the UN, told DW that the deployment of the military already means it is involved in this crisis. \"A military takeover is not the answer. The question is whether the army can play the role of an arbiter to bring this crisis to a peaceful conclusion,\" she said.\nProtesters in Islamabad say they won't leave the streets until Khan is free.\n\"We have faced all the hurdles and pain for Imran Khan, who is fighting for the people's rights and we will not leave this place until they will release Khan,\" protester Adnan Khan told DW.\n\"We are ready to die for Khan,\" he said.\nPakistan is \"on the brink\" and could face an even greater crisis unless a political solution is found and both sides take a step back, Lodhi underlined.\n\"It is uncertain if protesters can force Khan's release but they seem resolute and unyielding in defying the authorities but it is hard to predict how the situation will play out,\" Lodhi added.\n\"The threat of violence is ever present with thousands on the streets of the capital and even greater numbers of police, paramilitary and regular troops in eyeball-to-eyeball confrontation,\" the former diplomat warned.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe ongoing protest is led by Imran Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, who described the demonstration as a \"do or die\" sit-in.\nKhan's media advisor Zulfikar Bukhari said the government can only stop the protests by \"increasing the intensity of brutality\" and accused security forces of already killing three protesters.\n\"At the moment the most dangerous scenario is (the government) giving orders to the rangers to shot directly at the peaceful protesters. I think they will look to make an excuse to fire and increase the levels of brutality to try to make thousands of protesters come in fear,\" Bukhari told DW.\nPakistan has seen continuous violent protests since Khan's removal from power, including a days-long confrontation in Islamabad last month.\nThe country has a long history of turbulent politics and civil unrest with multiple military coups. The most recent one took place in 1999 when General Pervez Musharraf ousted Nawaz Sharif, the brother of the current prime minister. The country has also spent decades under military rule.\nImran Khan hinted at the military and a foreign conspiracy being behind his ouster after losing a no-confidence vote in the parliament in April 2022 but the military leaders rejected those claims.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nEdited by: Darko Janjevic"

    "content": "The German parliament has passed a law aiming to reorganize the health sector, slashing the number of hospitals, boosting clinics and digitalizing bureaucracy. Health Minister Karl Lauterbach called it a \"revolution.\"\nGermany's upper house of parliament has passed the law on the restructuring of the hospital sector, paving the way for its gradual implementation starting January 2025 and ending in 2029. The chamber representing Germany's 16 federal states passed the law following a heated debate, with the center-right Christian Democrats demanding more leeway for the implementation.\nThe hospital reform is the brainchild of Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, who described the reform as \"nothing short of a revolution.\" Speaking at an annual doctors' conference in early May, the German health minister said the reform plans they had been working on for two years marked a \"Zeitenwende\" (turning of the times) in German health care — an allusion to the military overhaul Chancellor Olaf Scholz announced after Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nThe two-pronged hospital reform will change the way German hospitals are financed and impose new care standards.\nGermany has the highest number of hospital beds per capita in the European Union, at 7.9 beds per 1,000 inhabitants, compared to the EU average of 5.3. But maintaining these is expensive. According to Lauterbach, this has left many hospitals on the brink of bankruptcy. The result is that patients are being kept in hospital unnecessarily so hospitals can charge health insurers extra money — which in turn drives up the whole country's health costs and insurance contributions.\nThe reform means that hospitals will no longer be paid per treatment — instead, they will get a guaranteed income for making certain services available. This, it is hoped, will alleviate the financial pressure on hospitals to pack in as many operations and treatments as they can, even if they are poorly qualified to carry them out.\nThis measure is supposed to ensure that patients needing complex treatments are referred to specialists earlier. This, according to the Health Ministry, will reduce health costs in the long run, as patients stand a better chance of being cured and are less likely to fall victim to mistakes, as hospital staff will be less rushed and overworked. Lauterbach has claimed this reform will save tens of thousands of lives a year.\n\"The hospital reform is right and important,\" Dirk Heinrich, an ear-nose-throat specialist and chairman of the doctors' association Virchowbund, told DW. \"We do have too much in-patient care, but what is happening now is way too little. Reforming the hospitals without a comprehensive outpatient treatment reform, and without emergency care reform, won't make a difference.\"\nEugen Brysch, chairman of patients' protection organization Deutsche Stiftung Patientenschutz was also skeptical. \"In the field of outpatient medical care, elderly, chronically ill and care-dependent people will find it almost impossible to find a new doctor,\" he said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany also struggles with a lack of doctors' offices in rural areas, as fewer doctors want to live there. The Health Ministry wants to tackle this issue by offering extra money for clinics in rural areas. Here again, Brysch was cautious.\n\"The fact that better earning opportunities are now being created will not in itself lead to more doctors in rural areas. After all, other location factors also play a role,\" he said.\nOne issue has been resolved in the new reforms: a cap on payments for general practitioners. Doctors have long complained about this budget limit — and occasionally gone on strike over it — because they say it often forces them to treat patients for free. Scrapping the cap, Lauterbach hopes, will provide doctors with incentives to take on more patients.\nHeinrich welcomed this move, but again, said it failed to go far enough. \"It stops halfway because the budgets remain in place for specialist doctors,\" he said. \"It's no use for a patient if they get an appointment quicker at their family doctor but then have to wait months for a specialist.\"\n\"A few hundred hospitals will close,\" Lauterbach told the tabloid Bild am Sonntag after the reform passed the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, in October. There isn't enough medical demand for these hospitals, he added, explaining that one-third of all hospital beds are empty and still there aren't enough nurses.\n\"We have such an inefficient system, in no other country in Western Europe is life expectancy lower than in Germany,\" Lauterbach said, arguing that \"centralization will improve the quality of care.\"\nHealth insurance contributions are set to increase next year also due to the reform. However, Lauterbach told Bild am Sonntag that he does not expect any further increases in the following year, if his health reform proposals are implemented.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nThis article has been updated to reflect the passing of the law on November 22, 2024.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "Follow:\nElon Musk plowed at least $260 million into efforts to send Donald Trump back to the White House, new filings show – a massive infusion that makes him one of the largest single political underwriters of a presidential campaign and underscores the outsized influence of the world’s wealthiest person on this year’s election.\nThursday’s filings with the Federal Election Commission show that the Tesla and SpaceX executive gave a total of $238 million to a super PAC that he founded this year, America PAC, which worked to turn out voters on Trump’s behalf in key states.\nBut he also was the financial backer of other groups that cropped up in the final days of the election to support Trump, including one that spent millions on advertising to defend his record on abortion. It had sought to link Trump’s views on abortion to those of late Supreme Court Justice and liberal icon Ruth Bader Ginsburg.\nMusk, through a trust that bears his name, donated $20.5 million to the group, named RBG PAC, on October 24, according to filings with the Federal Election Commission. He was the sole donor to the group, which was formed in mid-October. The donation’s timing meant that Musk’s involvement was not disclosed until Thursday’s post-election filings with the federal regulators.\nGinsburg’s granddaughter, Clara Spera, publicly denounced the ads – which sought to neutralize abortion as a liability for Trump in the campaign – as misleading and an “affront” to Ginsburg’s legacy as a staunch defender of abortion rights.\nAccording to the new filings, Musk also donated $3 million to the MAHA Alliance, a super PAC that ran stark ads in key swing states urging supporters of Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to back Trump in the closing stretch of the campaign. Kennedy himself had ended his independent campaign over the summer and endorsed Trump.\nMAHA stands for “Make America Healthy Again,” Kennedy’s spin on Trump’s MAGA catchphrase. Trump has now tapped Kennedy, one of the nation’s most prominent anti-vaccine conspiracy theorists, to oversee the Health and Human Services Department.\nMusk has emerged as a key player in Trump’s orbit during the transition to a second White House term. The president-elect has tapped the tech magnate, along with former Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy, to oversee a new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, aimed at cutting government spending. Musk spent part of Thursday on Capitol Hill, meeting with lawmakers as part of early talks into trimming the size of government.\nTrump has selected other big donors for roles in his incoming administration.\nHoward Lutnick, the Cantor Fitzgerald investment bank chief whom Trump has tapped to head the Commerce Department, made a nearly $3 million “in-kind” donation of stock on October 21 to a pro-Trump super PAC, MAGA Inc., according to the organization’s filings Thursday night.\nThat’s on top of the $6 million that Lutnick previously donated to the super PAC over the course of the election cycle.\nOther Trump supporters who have landed spots in his administration also donated to MAGA Inc. They include Linda McMahon, the former wrestling company executive tapped to serve as Education secretary. She donated more than $20 million to the Trump-aligned super PAC this cycle.\nMcMahon and Lutnick also serve as co-chairs of Trump’s transition operation.\nOther Trump picks who have made seven-figure donations to MAGA Inc. include former Georgia Sen. Kelly Loeffler, his choice to lead the Small Business Administration; Scott Bessent, whom Trump has selected as Treasury secretary; and two of his choices for plum diplomatic posts in Europe, Arkansas investor Warren Stephens and Charles Kushner, the father-in-law of Trump’s daughter, Ivanka.\nOther uber-wealthy figures who made late donations include venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz, whose firm has invested in crypto businesses. They donated a combined $23 million in November to Fairshake, the crypto industry’s main super PAC, the new filings show. Fairshake and aligned groups spent heavily to influence congressional races. Andreessen and Horowitz also donated to a pro-Trump super PAC earlier in the cycle.\nTrump, who once dismissed cryptocurrency as a scam, has become a fan of digital assets and has made clear he intends to diverge from the Biden administration’s aggressive regulation of the industry. This week, he announced Paul Atkins, a crypto advocate and co-chair of the Token Alliance, as his pick to serve as chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission. On Thursday, Trump announced tech investor David Sacks will be his White House “czar” overseeing artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency policy.\nFairshake and its affiliates already have touted a $78 million stockpile for the 2026 midterm elections, in the form of campaign funds left over from this year’s elections and pledged donations.\nVice President Kamala Harris’ defunct presidential campaign had just $1.8 million in its account on November 25, according to the new filings with federal regulators, having virtually emptied its massive war chest of more than $1 billion.\nThe final cash on hand total follows intense scrutiny of the Harris campaign’s management of resources in its losing effort. Her frenzied spending in the final weeks of the campaign and Democrats’ aggressive efforts to secure donations after the election, drew intense scrutiny and raised alarms that her campaign was grappling with unpaid bills.\nBut after record-breaking fundraising, Harris’ operation appears set to close its books without debt, reporting $1.82 million in cash on hand.\nThe new report, covering activity from October 17 through November 25, also showed the Harris campaign burning through money during the intense home stretch — spending more than $270 million during that period.\nFor the entire campaign, including outgoing President Joe Biden’s time as the Democratic nominee, the campaign spent roughly $1.2 billion, according to the filing. It’s a gargantuan total, underscoring the soaring expense of modern campaigns, as well as the limits of financial firepower — Harris consistently out-raised Trump — against unforgiving political headwinds.\nTrump recently converted his presidential campaign committee into a leadership PAC called Never Surrender, Inc. It reported more than $11 million in debts as of November 25, largely owed to an Iowa firm for “telemarketing & data management,” according to its filing. The committee still had nearly $9.9 million in available cash at the end of the reporting period.\n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

Federal campaign finance data show he also donated to Republican groups and US Senate candidates this year.\nIn a statement, Stephens said he was honoured by the nomination.\n\"I have expressed to President Trump that I would be extremely proud to serve our country and his administration, working to implement the President’s agenda and further strengthen the long-standing alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom,” he said.\nHe and his wife also maintain a philanthropic organisation, the Harriet and Warren Stephens Family Foundation, which has donated to the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts, the University of Mississippi, and the Episcopal Collegiate School in Little Rock.\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "content": "President-elect Donald Trump has nominated businessman Warren Stephens to serve as America’s ambassador to the United Kingdom.\n“Warren has always dreamed of serving the United States full time,” Trump said in a statement on Truth Social. “I am thrilled that he will now have that opportunity as the top diplomat, representing the USA to one of America’s most cherished and beloved allies.”\nStephens, who is CEO of private Arkansas-based investment bank Stephens Inc, donated millions to Trump’s re-election campaign this year.\nIf his nomination is successful, Stephens will help to maintain the so-called “special relationship” between the US and the UK.\nThe two countries maintain close military, intelligence, and cultural ties.\nTrump has vowed to rework the US’ relationships abroad, vowing to implement an “America-first” ethos to foreign policy.\nThe role of US ambassador to the UK is one of the most coveted diplomatic positions, and presidents have been known to bestow the role to prominent backers.\nDuring his first term in office, Trump appointed Woody Johnson, a top Republican donor and owner of the American football team the New York Jets, as UK ambassador.\nBarack Obama chose long-time Democratic Party fundraiser and lawyer Louis Susman as his first emissary to the UK - or the Court of St James.\nStephens did not always back Trump’s candidacies, however. In 2016, when Trump first ran for president, Stephens donated about $4m (£3.1m) to political groups that sought to stop Trump’s ascent, the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette reported at the time.\nThe investment banker also donated over $2m to a political action committee that supported former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley as she unsuccessfully ran for president in 2024, the campaign finance watchdog OpenSecrets found.\nWhen Trump ultimately triumphed in this year’s Republican presidential primary, however, Stephens threw his support behind him. Federal campaign finance data show he also donated to Republican groups and US Senate candidates this year.\nIn a statement, Stephens said he was honoured by the nomination.\n\"I have expressed to President Trump that I would be extremely proud to serve our country and his administration, working to implement the President’s agenda and further strengthen the long-standing alliance between the United States and the United Kingdom,” he said.\nHe and his wife also maintain a philanthropic organisation, the Harriet and Warren Stephens Family Foundation, which has donated to the Arkansas Museum of Fine Arts, the University of Mississippi, and the Episcopal Collegiate School in Little Rock.\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "content": "Authorities in Romania have revealed details of what appears to be a major attempt to interfere in the country’s presidential elections using the social media platform TikTok, and with a series of cyber-attacks.\nRomania's domestic intelligence service says there are signs the effort was \"co-ordinated by a state-sponsored actor\".\nCalin Georgescu, a far-right Nato-sceptic who has previously praised Vladimir Putin, was almost unknown in Romania until he won the first round of voting in the presidential elections two weeks ago.\nNow Romanian intelligence says his sudden and surprise surge in popularity is down to a \"highly organised\" and \"guerrilla\" campaign on social media, sharing identical messaging and using influencers.\nThey say it was conducted from \"external locations\" to bypass controls.\nA separate intelligence assessment says that Romania has been identified as an \"enemy state\" by Moscow and a priority target for what it calls \"aggressive hybrid actions\".\nThe politically explosive information – which has landed just days before the second round of voting - comes from declassified documents published this evening by the outgoing president, Klaus Iohannis.\nThey reveal how paid content supporting Georgescu was promoted on TikTok, without being marked as election campaigning – in violation of the platform’s own rules and of Romanian electoral law. Other candidates’ content was subject to closer controls.\nGeorgescu has always said he spent \"zero\" on election promotion, denying he was even campaigning.\nBut the intelligence documents identify one TikTok account which they say made payments of $381,000 (£299,819; €361,872) in just one month from 24 October – to users who were promoting Georgescu.\nGeorgescu claims the release of the documents is a coordinated attempt to block his candidacy.\n“I think it’s the first time in the history of the world when a state is organising an action against a candidate to stop him from running,” he said in a TV interview on Wednesday.\nHe also denied knowing any of the influencers or funders mentioned in the reports.\nThe documents released in this highly unusual move were all papers drawn up for a meeting of the security council following the first round of the presidential election.\nThey also reveal that access data for electoral websites was stolen from legitimate users and published online “on cyber-crime platforms originating from Russia”.\nSeparately, the intelligence agencies report some 85,000 attempted hacks in an attempt to access electoral data and change content – including on election day. The report says the cyber-attackers used advanced methods to remain anonymous, working in a way and on a scale \"typical of state-sponsored actors\".\nAn investigation is ongoing to discover who was responsible and whether there was any impact on the election.\nRussia has denied any interference in Romania's election process.\nFar-right frontrunner Georgescu is due to face reformist candidate Elena Lasconi in a second round vote on Sunday.\nRomanian Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu – who came 3rd in the presidential race – has now announced he will \"fully endorse\" Elena Lasconi.\nBut that’s assuming the vote goes ahead. The prosecutor’s office is now examining the new documents.\n\"I hope that, based on the evidence published today, the state authorities will take appropriate action, and all those responsible will be held accountable,\" Ciolacu said.\nHe added that people's votes have shown they want the \"continuation of Romania's European development path\".\nA pro-EU protest has been called for Thursday evening.\nCommenting on the protest, Georgescu warned against possible unrest, citing the \"Maidan\" in Ukraine - the revolution of 2014 that ousted a pro-Russian president.\n\"Please stay at home with your family. We need social tranquillity. God will not let Romania down,” Georgescu said.\nSeventeen years after joining the EU, the two countries are given the green light to join the Schengen zone.\nRomanians are still stunned by the last-minute cancellation of the presidential election after allegations of \"massive\" meddling by Moscow.\nThe move comes after allegations of Russian influence via social media on the first round of voting.\nA court ruling follows intelligence allegations of Russian interference promoting a far-right candidate.\nThe shock move to annul Romania's election over interference throws any certainty out of the window.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "As Germany prepares for elections in February, concern has grown about the efforts of anti-democratic actors to sway public opinion through online manipulation. Tactics range from cyberattacks to AI propaganda.\nGermany is bracing for digital threats in the run-up to the general election.\nWith the country expected to elect a new parliament on February 23, authorities and researchers are raising concerns about the potential impact of hack-and-leak operations and disinformation campaigns aimed at swaying public opinion or sowing division ahead of the vote.\nIn a recent analysis, Germany's domestic intelligence agency warned of \"attempts by foreign states to exert influence.\"\nThis warning was echoed by Claudia Plattner, the president of Germany's cybersecurity agency, the Federal Office for Information Security (BSI), who told reporters that \"there are forces inside and outside Germany that have an interest in attacking the election process and disrupting the democratic order.\"\nThe snap election, held under a compressed timeline, not only poses logistical challenges for authorities — it also comes at a time of heightened political tensions.\n\"There are various issues, from the economy to the geopolitical situation, that are dividing society,\" Josef Lentsch, the CEO of the Political Tech Summit conference, which will take place in Berlin at the end of January, told DW.\n\"Populists and extremists are particularly good at exploiting these social divides,\" he said.\nCyberattacks on prominent individuals and organizations may pose a significant threat to the election, experts say. Once obtained, sensitive data can be used in coordinated \"hack-and-leak\" operations, in which stolen material — often altered or taken out of context — is released to undermine the credibility of political candidates or parties.\n\"Against the backdrop of the Russian war of aggression against Ukraine, Russia probably has the greatest and most obvious interest in influencing the election in its own favor,\" Germany's domestic intelligence agency, the Federal Office for the Protection of the Constitution (BfV), warned in late November.\nBut domestic actors operating from within Germany pose an equally significant risk to the integrity of the election, Lentsch said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"The public sphere has evolved,\" he said. \"Anti-democratic actors are now using channels on messaging platforms like WhatsApp and Telegram, as well as social media platforms like TikTok, to circumvent the filtering functions of traditional media and other trusted entities.\"\nBoth extremist fringe actors and parties such as the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) have spent years building this \"alternative digital infrastructure,\" Lentsch said. \"As a result, they now have almost a decade's head start over other actors, such as the established parties.\"\n\nThe political firepower of this kind of digital infrastructure was demonstrated in the first round of Romania's presidential election, with the surprise victory of nationalist Calin Georgescu, a far-right admirer of Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nOn Friday, December 6, Romania's Constitutional Court annulled the results after President Klaus Iohannis had declassified security documents. The documents alleged that Russia had run a campaign involving thousands of social media accounts on platforms such as TikTok and Telegram to promote Georgescu.\n\"Romania is an EU country. What happened there can happen elsewhere, including in Germany,\" Lentsch said.\nIn Germany, no party has built a larger \"digital infrastructure\" to push its narratives than the AfD, Katja Munoz, a research fellow at the Center for Geopolitics, Geoeconomics and Technology at the Berlin-based think tank German Council on Foreign Relations, told DW.\nWithin this network, multiple social media accounts interact with each other to prompt the platforms' algorithms to amplify the reach of posts, Munoz said: \"It's an orchestrated move to push the same narrative.\"\nAt the same time, new so-called generative AI programs allow parties and individuals to create posts — from text to images and even video — much faster than before. Officials from across the political spectrum have begun using the technology to create illustrations for social media posts, for example.\nAnd yet \"in Germany, we see that the party that spreads by far the most AI-generated content is the AfD,\" Munoz said, referring to an analysis she conducted around the European elections, as well as regional elections in 2024.\n\"This content is not necessarily false, but it's misleading and meant to confirm existing beliefs — it's AI propaganda,\" she said, citing the example of a 78-second AI-generated video released by the AfD in September, just days before a regional election. The clip depicted scenarios in which people who were mostly blond and blue-eyed were contrasted with people of color, who were shown in negative contexts.\nA multipronged approach is needed to protect the integrity of Germany's campaign and election, experts say.\nTo counter cyberattacks, the BfV has formed a special task force to monitor threats. The cybersecurity agency BSI is offering online seminars to candidates and parties to help them secure their devices and online accounts against cyber intruders.\n\"Normally we would have liked to do this on site and in person, but now we have to switch to webinars simply because we don't have as much time to prepare as we thought,\" BSI President Plattner told the public broadcaster Deutschlandradio.\nWith only about two and a half months remaining until the expected elections, Lentsch said: \"It is all the more important that civil society, political actors and state authorities engage in dialogue, especially as the period leading up to the elections has shortened.\"\nMunoz said authorities should also step up efforts to raise awareness about disinformation and AI-generated propaganda: \"Officials should explain to people how public opinion is being manipulated and how fringe views are being pushed to the center of the debate.\"\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "After Donald Trump's US election win and with an early federal election slated to take place in Germany on February 23, questions are being asked about what role social media could — and should — play in party campaigns.\nThe leaders of Germany's traditional parties are clearly nervous about the rise of populist parties.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) secured just over 30% of the vote in recent state elections in Thuringia and Saxony, which was partly attributed to the party's effectiveness at reaching first-time voters on TikTok.\nMatthias Kettemann, an expert on internet regulation and media law at the University of Innsbruck in Austria, argues that it its impossible to say exactly what impact social media has in shaping public opinion and democratic decision-making processes more broadly.\nHowever, what is clear is that more and more people are using social media and that there is a general trend toward polarization. \"The parties on the far right and far left tend to do much better on social media because they tend to have easier stories to tell, which in turn foster engagement together with the amplification algorithms of the platforms,\" Kettemann told DW.\nObservers are also wary of the growing influence of Elon Musk, the world's wealthiest man and CEO of the platform X, who was arguably Trump's greatest ally in his successful campaign to retake the US presidency.\nAfter Germany's ruling coalition government collapsed on November 6, Musk repeatedly referred to Germany's center-left leaders as \"fools.\"\nMeanwhile, Vice Chancellor and Economy Minister Robert Habeck, of Germany's Green Party, this week made a surprise comeback to the microblogging platform following a six-year break, saying he did not think it was right to leave X to the \"loudmouths and populists.\"\n\"The most important problem is disinformation from the top,\" said Jörg Hassler, an expert in digital and political communication at Ludwig Maximilian University in Munich. He said political leaders now focus more on making personal attacks on their competitors or engage in debates on side issues like election dates.\nDuring a debate in the Bundestag on Wednesday, center-right Christian Democrat (CDU) leader Friedrich Merz expressed his disgust at AI-generated fake videos about him that had been circulating online and shared on social media. \"The fact that they are being posted and forwarded by Social Democrat lawmakers gives a taste of the kind of election campaign you are obviously prepared to run here in Germany,\" Merz said.\n\"The important issues are how well the economy does, whether people are able to get state welfare and so on, but it appears that politicians aren't interested in talking about those,\" said Kettemann.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nWhile campaign tools developed in the US are subject to strict legal and regulatory limits in Germany, for example through data protection laws and laws around party financing, social media has become an important part of the hybrid media ecosystem, in which information loops between social media and traditional media outlets.\n\"You can't win elections on social media, but you can lose them,\" said Hassler. He pointed to the example of Armin Laschet, who ran as the CDU candidate for chancellor in the 2021 federal election. Laschet's campaign was effectively sunk after he was filmed laughing during a official visit to Rhein-Erft-Kreis, a region of Germany devastated by extreme flooding in July 2021. Outrage spread on X, then called Twitter, using the hashtag \"#laschetlacht\" (\"#laschetlaughs\").\nFor the first time in 2022, more German citizens said they mainly followed the news online rather than on television, as reported in the Reuters Institute annual survey for the Study of Journalism. According to the 2024 Media Study by German public broadcasters ARD and ZDF, only 7% of the German population uses X on a regular basis compared with Instagram (37%), Facebook (33%) and TikTok (18%).\nAnother important factor in the upcoming federal election, said Kettemann says, will be the role of foreign actors using disinformation operations, for example bot farms and \"dark campaigns\" on messaging apps such as Telegram and WhatsApp to push certain narratives. Germany's populist AfD and the  leftist Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW)have run on pro-Russia, socially conservative, anti-immigration and anti-climate protection platforms.\n\"We know for example that Russia much prefers certain political parties in Germany over others. They want to exacerbate the polarization tendencies within German society and that's a threat we should be keenly aware of in the run-up to the Bundestag election,\" said Hassler.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe EU has already introduced a comprehensive set of regulations for social media and digital marketplaces with the Digital Services Act (DSA) that aims to prevent illegal and harmful activities online, as well as the spread of disinformation.\nIn preliminary findings issued in July, EU regulators found X to be in breach of the DSA, stating that the blue check verification system \"deceives users,\" that the platform was not in compliance with \"required transparency on advertising\" and \"fails to provide access to its public data to researchers.\"\nThe challenge now will be to implement the legislation, said Kettemann, and that won't happen in time for the German federal election in February anyway. \"Some platforms like X don't seem to be cooperating whatsoever with the EU rules, so it will be quite challenging to bring that platform in line with democratic values and EU rules,\" he said.\nThis could be even more difficult in future because Musk's role is growing in US policy-making, Kettemann said, after US Vice President-elect JD Vance suggested this week that the US would withdraw support for NATO if the EU tried to regulate X.\nAs more and more voters, especially young voters, are informing themselves about politics and world affairs on social media, Ketterman urged traditional parties to step up their activities on social media platforms because they should not leave the field to disinformation actors.\n\"We have to fight the fight,\" he said.\nEdited by: Rina Goldenberg\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "In November, a little-known far-right radical took the most votes in the first round of Romania's presidential election. Now, amid reports TikTok played a role in the far-right win, the results have been annulled.\nThe Supreme Court of Romania has pulled the rip cord: On Friday, the judges annulled the results of the first round of the presidential election, held on November 24.\n\"The procedure for the election of the president of Romania will be completely reopened,\" the Constitutional Court announced. It made the decision “to ensure the correctness and legality of the electoral process.\"\nThe short video app TikTok is said to have played a role in the outcome. Calin Georgescu, the far-right and pro-Russian presidential candidate, was massively promoted via TikTok with the help of coordinated accounts, recommendation algorithms and paid advertising.\nGeorgescu, who was previously largely unknown, does not belong to any political party, polled extremely low in all preelection surveys and did not take part in any of the TV debates. Nevertheless, he won the first round of voting.\nThis was mainly due to his presence on social media, especially on TikTok.\nGeorgescu's channel has more than 520,000 followers and has garnered 5.7 million likes, and his campaign videos have been viewed on TikTok millions of times. In them, he not only criticizes Romania's political establishment — often making false claims against politicians — but is also seen doing judo or riding horses, just like the man he so admires: Russian President Vladimir Putin.\nWhen Georgescu won the first round of the election, many observers were incredibly surprised — and dismayed. The election brought the extreme-right conspiracy theorist, NATO critic and Putin admirer within a reasonable shot of winning the election in the second round, originally scheduled for Sunday.\nAccording to Romania's electoral authority, TikTok appears to have played a major role in Georgescu's success.\nThe short-video platform is very popular in Romania: About 9 million of the country's 19 million inhabitants, especially young people, use the service.\nAlthough other leading Romanian politicians are present on TikTok, none have managed to reach anywhere near as many people as Georgescu. The upshot, however, was that just under a third of 18- to 24-year-olds voted for Georgescu, despite his outlandish theories — among them, for example, that the 1969 moon landing was staged.\nHowever, the electoral authority accused TikTok of giving Georgescu an advantage. Before the vote, it had instructed the platform that presidential candidates must be identified as such and must disclose their financial sources.\nIt said that in the case of Georgescu, TikTok did not enforce this rule, thereby giving him an advantage over the other candidates. Romania's media watchdog has called on the EU to investigate the video-sharing platform.\nTikTok has rejected all allegations, pointing to the fact that it removed tens of thousands of fake accounts and millions of fake likes and followers leading up to the election.\nThe social media service also claimed that it had found no indication of covert interference from either inside Romania or abroad.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMarcus Bösch, a German communications scientist and TikTok expert, told DW he sees this as a glaring contradiction. \"How can it be that countless accounts and likes were removed even though there was no indication of interference?\"\nUS linguist Adam Aleksic believes the main problem in the algorithms of modern social media platforms, which are no longer based on the follower principle. Simply put, this means users no longer see posts from the people they follow, but from the people who shout the loudest.\nWriting for the online magazine User Mag on November 9, Aleksic said \"algorithms use engagement as a metric for virality, and misinformation tends to generate more engagement. Claims about, say, Haitians eating household pets are going to elicit the extreme responses needed for virality. Even attempts to correct those falsehoods can paradoxically register as additional engagement.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nAleksic added that the days of detail, accuracy and nuance on online platforms are gone, and that extreme views are becoming normalized.\nAs Bösch sees it, the main problem is that TikTok is being used by many people, while strong, independent media brands are disappearing from the market.\nHowever, he said this is true not only of TikTok, but of all social media platforms.\n\"But TikTok is the 'app of the moment,' and this means that lots of themes and trends are subsequently found on other platforms,\" said Bösch.\n\"Societies, politicians and platform operators must understand that these threats and attempts to influence people exist and will continue to exist, and must correspondingly become more resilient, better prepared and more willing to take action in the context of strategic communication,\" he said.\nThis article was originally published in German on December 4, 2024. It was updated and republished following the Supreme Court's annulment of Romania's election results on December 6."

Bucharest has released intelligence linking Moscow to surprise pro-Russian winner Calin Georgescu.\nThe European Union (EU) has ordered TikTok to freeze data linked to recent Romanian elections due to possible interference, the bloc said in a statement on Thursday.\nThe European Commission issued a \"retention order\" under the bloc's sweeping Digital Services Act (DSA), which regulates how social media platforms and tech companies operate in Europe.\nThe EU demanded TikTok \"freeze and preserve data related to actual or forseeable systemic risks\" the platform could pose to \"electoral processes and civic discourse\" in the EU.\nEU Tech Commissioner Henna Virkkunen called the retention order a \"key step\" in the bloc's investigation into declassified Romanian intelligence reports that revealed Russian interference in the vote.\nRussia on Thursday denied the accusation.\nThe EU's skepticism comes amid concerns over potential outside meddling in an election that saw independent pro-Russia ultranationalist Calin Georgescu emerge from relative obscurity to become the front-runner after the first round of the presidential contest on November 24.\nIn response to the EU's order, TikTok said it was \"cooperating\" with Brussels regarding the matter.\n\"We look forward to establishing the facts in light of some of the speculation and inaccurate reports we have seen,\" TikTok said in a statement.\nThe short-form video hosting service, owned by China's ByteDance, has refuted the suggestion of Romanian election interference via its platform.\nGeorgescu's campaign was run exclusively on social media with the candidate skipping TV debates and even forgoing campaign posters.\nInstead, he produced hundreds of TikTok videos presenting himself in various situations and settings, all emphasizing strength, tradition and faith — swimming in a winter lake, riding horseback in traditional Romanian costume, lighting candles in front of an icon in an orthodox church, etc.\nThe videos soon went viral, gathering millions of clicks. Other Facebook, Instagram and X channels also quickly popped up to support him.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nRomania's public prosecutor's office has also announced that it would be opening an investigation into Georgescu and whether money laundering and other illegal activities occurred during his campaign.\nGeorgescu claimed to have spent \"zero\" on his TikTok campaign, however, the declassified intelligence report released by Romania's Supreme Defense Council (CSAT) suggests a €1 million ($1.06 million) price tag.\nOn Wednesday, the US State Department addressed that issue in a statement, saying: \"We are concerned by the Romanian Supreme Council for National Defense (CSAT)'s report of Russian involvement in malign cyber activity designed to influence the integrity of the Romanian electoral process. Data referenced in the report should be fully investigated to ensure the integrity of Romania’s electoral process.\"\nIn the second round of elections on December 1, far-right parties performed well, though the ruling center-left Social Democrats emerged as the most powerful party and are hoping to put together a pro-EU coalition government.\nOn Sunday, December 8, Georgescu will face pro-EU reformist Elena Lasconi of the Save Romania Union (USR) party — who came in second in the November ballot — in a final vote.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\njs,jsi/ab (Reuters, AFP, AP)"

But real change is likely only possible with financial support from abroad.\nFormer President Macky Sall lost popularity due to a repressive style of governance and stagnating economic policies.\nHowever, high living costs, energy prices, growing poverty and unemployment — which led to violent popular protests — persist.\nThe charismatic, youthful duo of Diomaye and Prime Minister and PASTEF leader Ousmane Sonko, both longtime opposition figures and tax officials, swept to power in March on the back of enthusiastic support from young Senegalese.\nA court ruling banned PASTEF party leader Sonko from running for the presidency, so his deputy, Diomaye, ran as the presidential candidate. Sonko became prime minister after Diomaye's election victory.\nSonko frequently accused the outgoing government of corruption, cronyism and kleptocracy, while the World Bank and International Monetary Fund had also put relations with Senegal on hold. As a result, the new government inherited a Senegalese state in desperately poor financial health.\nAfter taking office, Diomaye dissolved the National Assembly and called new elections. He had previously complained parliamentarians had not been prepared to discuss the budget law.\nIbrahima Aidara, the head of the LASPAD laboratory for societies and powers at Senegal's Gaston Berger University, said it will be \"a marathon\" after the official election results to quickly draw up and adopt the budget for 2025.\nIt would have to align with pragmatic priorities and recognize the promises made to the Senegalese people, especially regarding institutional reform, youth employment, anti-corruption, accountability, education and health.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"The other priorities will revolve around dialogue and political stability. They should initiate constructive dialogue with other political parties, to promote a culture of trust,\" Aidara told DW.\nAidara noted that the proposed reforms offer a generational vision and a structure for the next five years of Diomaye's term in office.\nPape Ibrahima Kane believes there is real political will to reform Senegal and to not disappoint Senegalese voters. But the implementation may take years.\nKane pointed out that Senegal is a democracy which has never experienced a military coup, even if election results have often been contested.\n\"This is a clear indicator that the political system is well-organized in Senegal,\" Kane said.\nIt has become commonplace for losers to congratulate, and even pave the way, for election winners.\nYoung Senegalese have clear demands, while the influence of religious leaders and other players has become less important.\nFor observers this is further proof that it is Senegalese citizens who truly decide the nation's destiny and that there is acceptance of the democratic system.\nHowever, Kane sees elitism as a weak point. The elite have immense control and are often at odds with the greater population.\n\"We need more years to end this rift between the elite and the citizens and ensure that our political system is credible,\" Kane said.\nThis article was originally published in German.

Murillo is currently vice president.\nSome analysts believe the change guarantees that Murillo and the couples son Laureano Ortega would succeed Daniel Ortega as leaders. The reform has been widely criticized internationally.\nLuis Almagro, the chief of the Organization of American States,  a regional diplomatic body, this week described the move as \"an aberrant form of institutionalizing the marital dictatorship.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe reform also increases the power of the country's military and police and gives the state more control over the media and Church, to prevent them from falling into the hands of \"foreign interests.\"\nIt stipulates that \"traitors to the homeland\" can be stripped of their citizenship, which Ortega has already done in practice.\nThe revised constitution will define Nicaragua as a \"revolutionary\" and socialist state.\nIt also will include as a national symbol the red-and-black flag of the FSLN — a guerrilla group-turned-political party that overthrew US-backed dictator Anastasio Somoza in 1979.\nThe amendment must be approved a second time in February before it becomes effective.\nThe 79-year-old Ortega has ruled Nicaragua for 28 years, having first come to power in 1979 following the fall of dictator Anastasio Somoza.\nHe was voted out of office in 1990 but returned as head of state and government in 2007.\nCritics of Ortega's government say he and his 73-year-old wife have already exercised absolute power for years, gradually tightening control of all sectors of the state.\nThey describe Nicaragua as being run by a nepotistic dictatorship, which has jailed hundreds of Ortega's opponents.\nThe government violently repressed anti-government protests in 2018. The United Nations estimates more than 300 people died in the crackdown, with thousands of Nicaraguans fleeing into exile.\nOrtega's regime is under US and EU sanctions, while several countries, including the Vatican, have cut ties with Managua.\nA report published in September by the Geneva-based UN Human Rights Office (OHCHR) warned of a \"serious\" deterioration in human rights under Ortega's rule.\nThe report cited arbitrary arrests, torture, ill-treatment in detention, increased violence against Indigenous people and attacks on religious freedom.\nmm/dj (AFP, dpa, Reuters)"

    "content": "Romanians went to the polls for the first in a succession of elections. Anti-reform and anti-EU candidates and parties were previously expected to poll well in the presidential and parliamentary elections.\nRomania has featured less and less in EU politics in recent years. At first glance, this is surprising considering that it is the sixth-largest country in the European Union in terms of population size and of huge strategic significance given its location on the southeastern flank of both the bloc and NATO.\nThis is particularly relevant when one considers that, of all EU member states, Romania has by far the longest shared border with Ukraine. It is also the most important base for US and NATO forces in southeastern Europe.\nMoreover, it faces military threats like no other country in the EU: Russia's Shahed drones regularly explode either over or on Romanian territory. In 2023, the government in Bucharest went so far as to construct air raid shelters for residents in the Danube Delta.\nHowever, unlike Poland or the Baltic states, Romania contributes very little to debates about how to handle Russia and support Ukraine.\nRomania's general silence on this and other important political matters is largely down to President Klaus Iohannis, who has been in office for 10 years.\nSilence and a low profile on both the domestic and international political stage have become his trademark — even though the Romanian constitution sees the president as the country's most important voice at home and an important foreign policy player abroad.\nThis is the situation in Romania as the country heads into two weeks of elections.\nThe first round of the presidential election will take place on Sunday. A week later (December 1), Romanians will elect a new parliament, and a week after that (December 8), there will be a runoff in the presidential election if — as expected — none of the candidates gets an absolute majority in the first round.\nHaving served two terms, President Iohannis is no longer able to run. His support in society and political circles has hit rock bottom anyway.\nTen years ago, he ran for president promising root-and-branch reform and to liberate the country from evils such as corruption.\nBut Iohannis, who is a member of Romania's German minority and was previously mayor of Sibiu in Transylvania, never really found his feet in the presidential palace or Bucharest's political jungle, and soon slipped into a passive role.\nIt is against this backdrop that nationalist and anti-reform forces have gained strength.\nThe favorite going into Sunday's first round of the presidential election was Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD).\nBack in 1990, after the overthrow of the communist Ceausescu regime the previous year, the PSD — which then operated under a different name — was a melting pot for former regime officials.\nIt has dominated Romania's political landscape for 35 years, making it the only party that survived regime change in the former communist bloc.\nIn contrast to what its name suggests, the PSD does not have a social democratic orientation, but generally adopts right-wing populist, nationalist positions mixed with left-wing social rhetoric.\nFor many urban Romanians, the PSD is the epitome of corruption in the post-communist state. In rural regions in the east and south, however, it remains the dominant political force.\nCiolacu, who is currently at about 24% in the opinion polls, is a PSD veteran, having worked his way up to the top of the party and government from his early beginnings in provincial politics in the early 1990s.\nHe represents the conservative nationalist wing of the party and has on numerous occasions been linked to cases of alleged corruption, including a recent scandal surrounding a luxury trip.\nNevertheless, many Romanians see Ciolacu as a dependable PSD politician who guarantees stability and calm and never forgets the \"ordinary people.\"\nShould Ciolacu be elected president, it is unlikely that Romania will take an anti-European turn — as has been the case under Prime Minister Viktor Orban in Hungary. It is instead likely that Romania will remain a loyal member of the EU and NATO abroad, but that necessary justice and anti-corruption reforms will be stopped at home.\nThings will look very different indeed if George Simion is elected president.\nSimion, who was polling at about 15% before the election, is head of the Alliance for the Unity of Romanians (AUR). He is an anti-European ultranationalist, although he has hardly anything in common with the last two generations of Romanian nationalists, who were firmly rooted in the past.\nThe radical right leader has copied a lot from politicians like Donald Trump and Viktor Orban and garnered a lot of attention as a result of his social media activities. He is banned from entering Moldova and Ukraine because he claims parts of their territory should belong to Romania.\nSimion is also suspected of having links to the Russian secret service, although no proof of this has ever been provided.\nNeck and neck with Simion at 15% and vying for second place in the first round of the presidential election was Elena Lasconi, chairwoman of the progressive liberal Save Romania Union (USR).\nA former star journalist and presenter on a private TV channel, Lasconi entered politics a few years ago and was elected mayor of the southern Romanian town of Campulung.\nHer party, the USR, was established about a decade ago as an anti-corruption civic movement and stood for progressive, liberal policies.\nFor several years now, however, the USR has become bogged down in everyday party politics and repeated fights about the direction the party should take. The USR left a government coalition formed in 2020 with the National Liberal Party (PNL) and the Democratic Alliance of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR) after only 10 months following a dispute about judicial reform.\nElena Lasconi's political style and election campaign reflected the problems of the USR. She was trying to manage a balancing act between progressive politics and being in touch with ordinary people.\nA few years ago, she voted against gay marriage in a referendum initiated by the Orthodox churches, provoking a very public family dispute — her daughter identifies as \"part of the LGBTQ community\".\nLasconi now speaks out in favor of civil partnerships for members of the LGBTQ community but remains opposed to gay marriage. When speaking in public, she wears a large cross around her neck and clothes that are inspired by traditional Romanian costumes.\nShould it come to a runoff on December 8, Prime Minister Marcel Ciolacu would in all likelihood prefer to stand against George Simion.\nAs was the case in 2000, when former Communist Ion Iliescu faced off against ultranationalist Corneliu Vadim Tudor, it is likely that many Romanians would opt for what they see as the \"lesser evil,\" and that is Ciolacu.\nIf, on the other hand, Lasconi makes it into the second round, two contrasting Romanias would be pitted against each other: city against country, tradition against modernism, a rigid apparatus against the forces of reform.\nThe forecasts for the outcome of the parliamentary election on December 1 tell a remarkably similar tale: Recent polls suggest that the PSD will get 25% to 35% of the vote and both the nationalist AUR and the national liberal USR 15% to 21%.\nThis article was originally published in German."

    "content": "Angela Merkel was chancellor when Germany pulled the Bundeswehr out of Afghanistan and the Taliban conquered Kabul in 2021. She was the last witness to testify before a Bundestag committee of inquiry this week.\nThe international mission in Afghanistan lasted 20 years. Under the leadership of the US, Germany was also involved from the very beginning — both in a military and in a humanitarian capacity.\nThe mission came to an abrupt end on August 15, 2021, when the Taliban captured the presidential palace in Kabul.\nNobody in the German government, including Chancellor Angela Merkel, apparently saw the Islamists' rapid triumph coming. The evacuation of both German citizens and Afghan personnel was chaotic.\nSince 2022, a committee of inquiry in the Lower House of Parliament, the Bundestag has been trying to find out how this misjudgment came about. As the last witness, the former head of government has to answer several hours of questions from lawmakers.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nReading from a prepared statement, Merkel said Germany's participation in the US-led military invasion of Afghanistan was the correct decision even in retrospect. She repeated some of the phrases she used in a government statement just a few days after the Taliban's triumph.\nMerkel said there had been a \"well-founded hope\" that the military intervention would prevent terrorist attacks from being planned in Afghanistan.\nShe acknowledged that foreign governments had failed in Afghanistan on nearly every objective, from encouraging the rule of law to women's rights issues.\nMerkel said a lack of cultural understanding by Afghanistan's Western allies, nepotism and drug trafficking were reasons for the failures.\nMerkel says that initially, she was more reluctant to include local personnel from the field of development cooperation. In doing so, she wanted to avoid giving the impression that Germany was abandoning Afghanistan.\nMerkel's account is consistent with the testimony of her confidant at the time, Helge Braun, who coordinated the German government's Afghanistan policy in the Chancellery. Braun was questioned directly before Merkel in the committee of inquiry and also defended the Federal Intelligence Service (BND). The BND had considered a rapid takeover of power by the Taliban to be “rather unlikely”.\nThe Bundestag's committee of inquiry has been looking into decision-making procedures and actions of the German government and intelligence services, including the interaction with foreign actors.\nIt will have to present its final report before this legislative period ends in February 2025.\nMerkel-era Foreign Minister Heiko Maas and Development Minister Gerd Müller were among the last officials of the time to be questioned. Even right before the Taliban marched unopposed into the Afghan capital, Maas, of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), had claimed that such a scenario was very unlikely.\n\"All of us — the German government, the intelligence services, the international community — we all misjudged the situation,\" he said later.\nNow, three years later, the inquiry committee asked Maas for his assessment of the German government's policy in Afghanistan. \"The cooperation within the government was very transparent and thorough,\" Maas said.\nMaas acknowledged that, on some specific factual issues, there were different interpretations.\n\"But everyone tried to make the best of the situation,\" Maas said. He added that issuing visas for Afghan personnel who feared Taliban revenge could have been handled better. \"It may have been possible to get a lot of people out earlier if an agreement had been reached more quickly,\" Maas surmised.\nThis article was originally written in German. It was updated following former Chancellor Angela Merkel's testimony on December 5, 2024.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

    "content": "As aging populations exacerbate worker shortages, European countries are quietly luring skilled foreign workers — even as pressure from the far right to keep immigration down has increased.\nWith immigration the top political issue in Europe, particularly with the surge of the far right, pressure on governments to keep the numbers down has increased.\nAnd yet several countries, even those with a publicly anti-immigrant stance, are luring foreign workers to fill a large labor void and keep the economies in an aging continent running.\nThe European Union has identified 42 occupations that face labor shortages and has come up with an action plan to attract foreign workers. Nearly two-thirds of small and medium-sized businesses in the bloc say they cannot find the talent they need.\nOn the face of it, many European leaders, especially those on the far right, have advocated deals with third countries to curb the entry of immigrants or repatriate them elsewhere. And yet, amid much less fanfare, signs of a policy shift acknowledging the need for immigrants have come to light.\nItaly's far-right government, led by Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, has decided to recruit hundreds of thousands of foreign workers desperately needed to plug the gaping shortages.\n\"For the three-year period [from] 2023-2025, the government expects a total of 452,000 entries,'' the Italian government said last year, also admitting it is much less than the \"detected need of 833,000'' workers over that period of time.\nAccording to the IDOS Study and Research Center, Italy needs 280,000 foreign workers annually until 2050 to meet the labor shortfall in various sectors such as agriculture, tourism and health care — about half the number of asylum applications filed last year. The country faces labor shortages in 37 occupations, with nurses and other health care professionals in the most demand.\nThe government recently announced it will recruit 10,000 nurses from India to help make up a shortage that is three times that much. Italian Health Minister Orazio Schillaci said in October that India has an oversupply of nurses. \"There are 3.3 million nurses\" in India, he said. \"We want to bring here about 10,000.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSchillaci said the Indian nurses are professionally capable and will be recruited directly by Italian regions and placed wherever needed, once their ability to speak in Italian has been determined.\nMaurizio Ambrosini, a professor of sociology and a migration expert at the University of Milan, told DW that Meloni's government has been compelled to change policy by employers who are in desperate need of workers.\n\"Italian employers were very silent on the migration debate for years. I suppose they didn't want a battle with the right-wing parties,'' he said over the phone. \"But no longer.\"\nMany, even in her own coalition, see the policy as a strong reversal from Meloni, who once referred to pro-immigration policies as part of a left-wing conspiracy to “replace Italians with immigrants.\"\n\"I hoped now that we finally have a right-wing government the situation would change, but the right is getting worse than the left,'' said Attilio Lucia, a member of the far-right League party and the deputy mayor of Lampedusa, a tiny island that is the arriving port for many migrants.\nBusinesses may have also affected the thinking in the new Dutch government led by far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders' Freedom Party.\nASML, the country's largest company that manufactures semiconductor equipment, has said its success depends on talented people, wherever they come from. The company has suggested that inbound migration must not be restricted. Nearly 40% of the company's employees are foreign workers.\n\"We have built our company with more than 100 nationalities,\" Christophe Fouquet, ASML's CEO,  said at the Bloomberg Tech Summit in London last month. \"Bringing talent from everywhere has been an absolute condition for success, and this has to continue.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Netherlands has sought an exemption or an \"opt-out'' from the EU asylum system, which treats asylum as \"a fundamental right and an international obligation for countries.\" Media reports have suggested that high anti-immigrant rhetoric perpetuated by the far right has made skilled workers feel less welcome in the country.\nBut even the far-right political groups must grapple with the reality of just how much the companies need foreign workers to stay competitive.\nThe Netherlands has only marginally reduced the tax incentive for foreign workers — from 30% to just 27%. This tax break has been among the most attractive features for talented youth to move to the country, or \"knowledge migrants\" as the government calls them.\n\"This is a relatively small change in the total net income of highly skilled foreign workers,\" said Lisa Timm, a researcher on migration at the University of Amsterdam, \"I think it will have a negligible effect on migrant arrivals.\"\nGermany is on course to issue 200,000 visas to skilled workers this year, a 10% increase from 2023. This is due to an \"Opportunity Card\" scheme, residence permits that allow workers from countries outside the EU to come to Germany and seek employment, introduced in June.\nOn a recent visit to India, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said Germany is \"open for skilled workers\" and agreed to smooth out bureaucratic hurdles and increase visas for Indians from 20,000 to 90,000 annually.\nGermany needs around 400,000 new skilled employees a year to cover worker shortages, especially in the fields of engineering, IT and health care, and sees a potential workforce in trained Indians.\nOn the other hand, the rise of the far-right, anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany (AfD) in regional elections and a knife attack in the western German town of Solingen over the summer compelled Scholz to sign off on internal border checks in the EU \"to curb migration.\"\nSpeaking on the issue in July, Scholz said irregular migration to Germany must \"come down\" but also stressed the country's need for skilled foreigners.\nNearly all European countries face the same problem — labor shortages in an aging population. Despite an influx of immigrants, they don't want to appear to be allowing for migrant arrivals without visas.\nAmbrosini, the University of Milan professor, said European countries are having trouble reconciling two different immigration policies, one for public consumption that calls for \"border enforcement agreements with transit countries like Tunisia, or deportation to external facilities like Italy's Albania agreement.\n\"On the other hand, it is becoming clearer that they need workers, and they are coming up with new policies to attract a workforce that is not only skilled but also seasonal workers,\" he said. \"This second policy is kept a bit hidden, not too much publicized, and can be visible only to the employer associations.\"\nIn the end, it's about the governments being able to say they are in control of who is coming in and who gets to stay, said Ambrosini. But that's a myth, at least regarding blue-collar jobs, since employers receive references from those already in Europe for whom to hire.\n\"How will the employer know who to get from Peru, for instance?\"\nEdited by: Davis VanOpdorp"

    "content": "Germans will head to the polls early next year after the coalition led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz collapsed.\nBerlin, Germany – In some countries, a snap election is held in a matter of weeks.\nGermany, by contrast, will enjoy a leisurely three months before it goes to the polls in an election that is likely to be overshadowed by the return of Donald Trump to the White House, an increasingly perilous situation in Ukraine, and a flagging domestic economy.\n\n\n\n\nGermany’s ruling “traffic light” coalition, formed by the Social Democratic Party (SPD), Greens and Free Democrats (FDP) collapsed on November 6, after Chancellor Olaf Scholz dismissed his finance minister, FDP leader Christian Lindner.\nScholz has announced a vote of confidence will take place on December 16. The snap poll is expected to take place on February 23.\nThe three-way alliance formed after the 2021 elections was a rarity for Germany, and the FDP’s fiscal hawkishness always made an uneasy marriage with its centre-left partners, who campaigned in the 2021 elections on increased social and climate spending.\nThe final break came during preparations for the 2025 budget, with Scholz arguing to pause Germany’s “debt brake”, which tightly limits public borrowing. Lindner insisted on demanding major public spending cuts and rolling back climate targets.\nLast week in the Bundestag, Scholz accused the FDP leader of pitting the government’s financial and military support for Ukraine against German pensioners.\nThe national weekly newspaper Die Zeit reported that the FDP had deliberately provoked Scholz to collapse the coalition and force an early election, which the party has denied.\n“It was difficult to reconcile those three very different political ideas and ideologies,” said Markus Ziener, a senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund think tank, who believes infighting has weakened Germany’s position within the European Union at a time when the bloc is sorely in need of leadership.\n“The hope could be that the next elections will bring much more stable conditions to form a reliable government.”\nThe Christian Democratic Union (CDU) and its Bavarian sister party are currently polling at 32 percent, according to a recent INSA poll, more than all three of the coalition parties put together.\nFriedrich Merz, a former BlackRock board member who has moved the party rightward since becoming leader in 2022, is therefore well-placed to become the next chancellor.\nBased on current polling, he could lead a government with the SPD – based on the latest predictions likely to secure 16 percent, as a junior partner, a return to the familiar “grand coalition” that was in place for three of Angela Merkel’s four terms, or with the Greens, which are polling at 12 percent.\nMerz has promised to roll back several of the coalition’s reforms, including on climate. He wants to lower taxes, reduce social welfare spending and tighten the country’s borders.\n“It is time for a fundamental course correction in migration, security, foreign and economic policy,” Merz told the Bundestag last week.\nScholz, now the least popular chancellor in post-war German history according to polls, has indicated that he will run again as the party’s candidate.\nBut many senior figures in the SPD want to make a clear break with his tenure, and quickly. If he is to be deposed, Defence Minister Boris Pistorius is likely to replace him.\nThe far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is on course to record a historic result.\nAssessments from Germany’s domestic intelligence agency that several of the party’s state branches are right-wing extremist organisations have not prevented the party from polling second, at 20 percent.\nThough all other parties refuse to form a coalition with the AfD, a strong performance could increase its influence on powerful parliamentary committees.\nMeanwhile, the FDP and the socialist Left party are currently below the 5 percent threshold required to enter parliament. The newly formed, left-wing Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance is at 7 percent.\nTrump’s campaign promise to bring a quick end to the conflict in Ukraine, and threats to pull military assistance to President Volodymr Zelenskyy’s government, come at a time when the war-torn nation is losing ground to Russia in the east and facing major attacks on its energy infrastructure ahead of winter.\nIf Trump follows through, Germany, Ukraine’s second-largest backer, will be expected to dig deep and massively increase its military spending.\nScholz recently spoke with Russian President Vladimir Putin for the first time in two years. He tends to tread a more careful approach and has refused to deliver long-range Taurus missiles out of fears of escalating the conflict.\nBy comparison, Merz has been more hawkish on weapons deliveries and indicated he would approve the transfer, in line with the policies of the United Kingdom, France and the United States.\nPotentially adding further strain to the budget, Trump’s plans to slap 20 percent tariffs on all imports and 60 percent on Chinese imports would have severe consequences for the economy, as Germany remains heavily reliant on exporting manufactured goods.\nEurope’s largest economy is also its slowest growing.\nThough it has narrowly skirted recession, Germany’s central bank said on Tuesday that the present stagnation is likely to continue in the face of weak international demand and investment, and the prospect of new US tariffs.\n“We’re basically in a squeeze here. On the one hand, we probably have to deal with direct additional customs in the United States,” said Ziener.\n“On the other hand, we will probably be very much affected by high duties against Chinese products.”\nWith no end in sight to the economic woes, more financial institutions and business representatives are calling for a reform of Germany’s debt brake to increase public investment, which has lagged for years.\nMerz, long known as a fiscal disciplinarian, has recently suggested an openness to reforming it, a possible sign of a shifting consensus.\nThe constitutional-anchored measure limits borrowing to 0.35 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), but special investment off-budget funds worth hundreds of billions have been used to circumvent it.\nDezernat Zukunft, a research institute that advocates for reform of the debt brake, estimates that Germany requires public spending of $782bn before 2030, which it says can be achieved without constitutional amendments.\n“The deeper question is whether there’s a political majority for debt finance in Germany,” said Max Krahe, director of research at Dezernat Zukunft, a research institute that campaigns for reform of the debt brake.\n“To say, yes, we are willing to use debt as a financing instrument to tackle all the problems in front of us, whether it’s defence, decarbonisation, infrastructure, competitiveness, education, healthcare.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "In these politically difficult times, Germany is looking for partners in Latin America who are willing to seal the EU-Mercosur trade agreement. However, opposition has grown after 25 years of talks.\nWhen Olaf Scholz comes back to Germany from the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, on Wednesday, the crisis-ridden chancellor could be returning with something truly historic: a free-trade agreement between the European Union and the Mercosur states of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay. That is, if he can seal the deal after decades of negotiations.\n\"This free-trade agreement would be liberating for the German economy. It's almost impossible to imagine a more difficult situation geopolitically — we have to use this opportunity,\" Volker Treier, the foreign policy leader of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry, told DW.\n\"Right now the window is open — you can't negotiate for 25 years, not have a deal, and still believe you can just keep stretching it out like chewing gum,\" Treier said. \"If not now, when?\"\nTreier noted a recent business survey from the Association of European Chambers of Commerce and Industry in Brussels. The result, he said, was \"pretty dismal.\"\nWith the European Union facing US protectionism under the incoming Trump administration, Treier said, an agreement with Mercosur would be an important signal for EU and German businesses. When it comes to batteries, solar panels, wind energy and green hydrogen, he said, the European Union could achieve its green transformation more quickly and sustainably with the help of raw materials from Latin America.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn return, European businesses would no longer pay €4 billion ($4.2 billion) in tariffs to export their goods to Mercosur countries, according to Treier. \"We already have good relations with Mercosur, but there's no real dynamism. In part, that is because Mercosur countries are imposing 25-30% tariffs on classic German export products like cars, but also electronics or machined goods,\" said Treier.\nKaja Kallas, the EU's incoming foreign affairs chief, echoed those sentiments. \"If we don't do a trade agreement with them, then this void will be filled by China,\" she said during her confirmation hearing before the European Parliament this week. China has increased its investment in the region by a factor of 34 between 2020 and 2022, and the first Chinese-controlled mega-port in South America has just opened for business in Chancay, Peru.\nIn the event the agreement isn't signed at the G20, proponents are aiming to get it wrapped up at the Mercosur summit taking place in Montevideo, Uruguay, in early December.\nAt the same time, opposition to the deal is also gaining momentum in Europe and South America — and it's not just coming from environmentalists. European farmers are livid, criticizing double standards and unfair competition with their South American colleagues.\nIn an appeal printed in the French daily newspaper Le Monde, some 600 French parliamentarians called for European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to refrain from signing the agreement. Moreover, and potentially more ominously, French Prime Minister Michel Barnier has said Paris would not agree to the deal in its current form.\n\"The agreement between Mercosur and the EU is far more advantageous to Europe than it is to South America,\" as Raul Montenegro, an Argentine biologist and 2004 Right Livelihood Award winner, told DW. \"The main losers in an eventual agreement will definitely be biological diversity in South America, as well as the small and midsized businesses and poor in both regions.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nG20 host Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who hopes to enshrine the fight against hunger and climate change in the Rio summit's final communique, is facing a herculean task when it comes to the endless discussion of free-trade agreements, yet remains upbeat.\n\"I have never been so optimistic about the EU-Mercosur,\" the Brazilian president said on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York in September. Lula is determined to heave Brazil into the role of a global player in his third and likely last term in office.\nThat is yet another reason that Treier of the German Chamber of Commerce and Industry said time is fleeting.\n\"Self-confidence is increasing among the Mercosur countries, the same way it is across the Global South. We were in India two-and-a-half weeks ago for our Asia conference and the same thing is happening there: They are still willing to reach out to us, but things won't stay that way forever,\" he said.\nThis article was originally written in German."

Russian rocket fire on cities in Ukraine has recently increased again.\nThe debate was reignited in Germany again after US President Joe Biden — just two months before the end of his term in office — reportedly decided to allow Ukraine to use long-range missiles produced in the United States against targets in Russia. Biden is said to have changed his mind partly because Russia has persuaded North Korea to send thousands of soldiers to fight in the war.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn view of Ukraine's precarious military situation, more and more people are now calling for Germany to deliver Taurus missiles to Ukraine.

The party wants to take this to the Bundestag: It is considering putting a motion to parliament for a vote before the early federal election on February 23.\nOne of the most vehement German supporters of the Taurus delivery is Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann, a member of the European Parliament for the FDP. Referring to Biden's decision, she wrote on the social media platform X: \"I hope that Chancellor Olaf Scholz will have the same belated realization at the end of his term of office in the interest of Europe's security.

Some places in Ukraine are so close to the Russian border that air defense is of no help, the foreign minister said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSo far, the government has only allowed Ukraine to use German weapons in the Russian territories bordering the city of Kharkiv, which has repeatedly come under heavy fire from the Russian side.\nThough there are many voices in favor of delivering the Taurus, Scholz remains categorically opposed to delivering the weapon system. He argues that Germany runs the risk of being drawn into the war between Russia and Ukraine if the Taurus cruise missiles are used. \"We must not be linked in any way or at any place with the targets that this system achieves,\" he said.\nScholz sees no reason to reconsider this position, his spokesman said on Monday, reaffirming what the chancellor said in his government declaration Wednesday. Scholz continues to receive backing for his course from his party. The delivery of Taurus is out of the question, said SPD leader Saskia Esken: \"We will stick to that.\"\nIn March, the CDU parliamentary group brought a motion calling for the deliveries before the Bundestag. At the time, the parliamentary groups of the SPD, Greens and FDP voted against it unanimously — in face of opposition from FDP politicians Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann and Wolfgang Kubicki. The motion failed.\nShould the FDP table another motion and should it be adopted, it would still be nonbinding. It is not the Bundestag that decides on arms deliveries, but the Federal Security Council, a secret Cabinet committee chaired by the chancellor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Some places in Ukraine are so close to the Russian border that air defense is of no help, the foreign minister said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nSo far, the government has only allowed Ukraine to use German weapons in the Russian territories bordering the city of Kharkiv, which has repeatedly come under heavy fire from the Russian side.\nThough there are many voices in favor of delivering the Taurus, Scholz remains categorically opposed to delivering the weapon system. He argues that Germany runs the risk of being drawn into the war between Russia and Ukraine if the Taurus cruise missiles are used. \"We must not be linked in any way or at any place with the targets that this system achieves,\" he said.\nScholz sees no reason to reconsider this position, his spokesman said on Monday, reaffirming what the chancellor said in his government declaration Wednesday. Scholz continues to receive backing for his course from his party. The delivery of Taurus is out of the question, said SPD leader Saskia Esken: \"We will stick to that.\"\nIn March, the CDU parliamentary group brought a motion calling for the deliveries before the Bundestag. At the time, the parliamentary groups of the SPD, Greens and FDP voted against it unanimously — in face of opposition from FDP politicians Marie-Agnes Strack-Zimmermann and Wolfgang Kubicki. The motion failed.\nShould the FDP table another motion and should it be adopted, it would still be nonbinding. It is not the Bundestag that decides on arms deliveries, but the Federal Security Council, a secret Cabinet committee chaired by the chancellor.\nThis article was originally written in German.\nWhile you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

In addition, the German government wants to finance part of the costs for the transmission grids so that the grid fees do not increase in 2025.\nHowever, Scholz lacks a majority in parliament since he fired former finance minister Christian Lindner, and passing these proposals would require support from the opposition.\nAction is also needed at the EU level to shore up the ailing steel industry, a spokesman for German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said after a steel industry summit.\nAccording to Steffen Hebestreit, Scholz has called on the European Commission to act decisively when it comes to distortions of competition caused by dumping and market-distorting subsidies, and that the EU must consider further trade protection measures for the steel sector.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nGermany is the largest steel producer in the EU.

    "content": "Brazil is preparing to host the G20 summit, with the administration of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva pulling out all the stops to turn the gathering into a major foreign policy success.\nWorld leaders, including US President Joe Biden, China's Xi Jinping and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, will be attending the Group of 20 (G20) summit in Rio de Janeiro, which will take place November 18-19.\nThe G20 is a collection of leading economic nations that account for roughly two-thirds of the world population and 80% of world trade. The grouping was founded in 1999 to deal with financial crises and economic disruptions by bringing together the world's largest economies.\nIt gained prominence during the 2008 global financial crisis when it began holding annual summits of national leaders.\nThe forum has since evolved into somewhat of a \"mini UN\" that deals with issues like climate change and geopolitical tensions, even though member states do not always agree on what should be on the agenda.\nBrazil took over the body's annually rotating presidency from India last December, and South Africa will assume the presidency for the next year.\nThroughout the year, Brazil has hosted and chaired multiple G20 ministerial meetings.\nLuiz Inacio Lula da Silva's government has putissues that concern the developing world at the heart of the nation's G20 presidency. These include the reduction of inequalities, reforming of global governance institutions like the International Monetary Fund and World Trade Organization and the need to tackle climate change and promote environmentally sustainable economic development.\nM. Habib Abiyan Dzakwan, a researcher focusing on international economic policy at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) Indonesia, a Jakarta-based think tank, said Brazil must strengthen the G20 countries' approach to crucial issues such as climate change and global health challenges.\n\"Consolidation among emerging economies is very important because developing countries cannot expect too much from the United States, especially under the next [Donald] Trump administration,\" he told DW. \"The same applies to Europe; we cannot rely on them too much either.\"\nBut it's unclear what Brazil will be able to achieve in concrete terms.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe summit will also likely offer an opportunity for leaders to discuss divisive issues such as Russia's war in Ukraine and the conflict in the Middle East.\nA look at the G20 summits over the past two years, hosted by India last year and Indonesia in 2022, shows the challenge faced by Brazil in achieving a consensus on a joint leaders' declaration.\nIndia was able to notch a diplomatic victory by negotiating a consensus last year, with the final joint declaration touching on the Ukraine war but avoiding specifically condemning Russia.\nInstead, it categorized the \"human suffering and negative added impacts\" of the war in an economic context \"with regard to global food and energy security, supply chains, macro-financial stability, inflation and growth.\"\nAjay Bisaria, a former Indian diplomat, said that the summit was \"indicative of India's ability to balance its historically stable partnership with Russia while nurturing its relationship with Western countries.\"\n\"More than just balancing key relationships, what India attempted in geopolitics was to bridge divides. This applied both to the East-West divide and to the North-South one,\" he added.\nAt last year's event, the African Union also became a permanent member of the G20.\nThe move was seen as a way to highlight the importance of including the \"Global South\" in multilateral forums.\nObservers in India say the summit in New Delhi bolstered their country's image as a growing diplomatic and economic force on the global stage, particularly at a time when the world was confronting multiple geopolitical and economic crises.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nDuring Indonesia's presidency a year earlier, the G20 leaders gathered on the idyllic island of Bali.\nIt was one of the most acrimonious presidencies in the grouping's history.\nThe summit took place at a time doubts were being raised about the very effectiveness and usefulness of the G20, against the backdrop of Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, which caused unprecedented divisions within the club.\nIndonesian President Joko Widodo was keen on having the G20 leadership as the capstone of his presidency.\nAnd in the end the outcome of the summit exceeded expectations, marking a diplomatic coup for Jakarta.\nParticipants were able to agree on a carefully worded final declaration, noting that \"most members strongly condemned the war in Ukraine and stressed it is causing immense human suffering and exacerbating existing fragilities in the global economy.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nDzakwan, the CSIS researcher, said that each G20 presidency faces its own unique and increasingly complex challenges.\nHe noted that Indonesia's presidency in 2022 was significantly overshadowed by the Russia-Ukraine war, while India last year had to grapple with escalating tensions in the Middle East in addition to the Ukraine conflict.\nDzakwan argued that these challenges will continue to intensify, particularly with Donald Trump set to return to the White House after scoring a thumping victory in the US presidential elections.\n\"It has never been easy, especially since Donald Trump's first presidency. It demonstrates that multilateralism is not too effective, but rather more transactional,\" he told DW.\nArti Ekawati from DW's Indonesian service and Murali Krishnan from New Delhi contributed to this article.\nEdited by: Shamil Shams"

    "content": "Healthy soil is vital for water and food supply. But much fertile land is heavily degraded and turning to desert. Over the past two weeks, nations have been gathered in Saudia Arabia to discuss how to tackle the problem.\nThe drying out and degradation of Earth's land is an \"existential crisis\" that could affect 5 billion people by the end of the century, according to a UN reportreleased this week.\nFaced with depleted soils that no longer sustain farming, diminished water resources and collapsing ecosystems, increasing numbers will be forced to leave behind their homes and livelihoods.\nUN scientists say climate change, which is warming the planet and disrupting rainfall patterns, is the primary cause. Deforestation, unsustainable agricultural practices and increasingly severe and frequent droughts are also degrading Earth's land.\nThe question of just how the world can tackle these challenges brought 196 countries plus the European Union to Riyadh, a city in Saudi Arabia fittingly surrounded by desert, for COP16.\nOver two weeks, the countries, party to the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) signed 30 years ago, discussed ramping up action on drought resilience and land restoration. Ahead of the summit, the UNCCD said 1.5 billion hectares (3.7 billion acres) of desertified land needs to be restored by 2030.\nIt has been hyped as a \"moonshot moment\" for what experts say is an often overlooked crisis.\n\"The land degradation crisis receives far less attention than climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution, despite the fact that over 100 million hectares of land are degraded each year,\" said David Goodman, policy officer with the International Union for Conservation of Nature, an international NGO.\nA major focus of COP16 is creating a global framework for fighting drought.\n\"This phenomenon is sparing no country, no biome,\" said UNCCD chief Ibrahim Thiaw. \"The Philippines were hit by droughts for the first time this year. So, it is no longer only happening in dry areas. It is happening in boreal forest.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn a report published on the second day of talks, the UN warned that drought fueled by human destruction of the environment costs $300 billion per year.\nDroughts, which have increased by 29% since 2000, are the world's deadliest natural disasters on a global scale and are projected to impact 75% of the world's population by 2050.\nThere is a broad recognition of the need to shift from a crisis-driven drought response to a more proactive approach that emphasizes resilience and risk management, said Goodman.\n\"Despite the broad agreement on the need for greatly enhanced action on drought, the question of how best to get there remains contentious among the parties,\" said Goodman.\nSome countries, like those in Africa, want a drought management protocol that would be legally binding. But others would prefer a framework to guide and accelerate action.\nParties, including the EU, don't appear ready for binding action, said Emmanuel Seck, negotiator for Senegal at COP16.\n\"We may hope that within the coming COP, at least we come to an agreement and say that, 'yes, it is time for us to have this protocol,\" added Seck.\nAfrican countries are hit particularly hard by drought and its consequences, such as an inability to produce enough food to eat.\nDiscussions at COP16 this year have also highlighted that worsening drought, desertification and land degradation are already forcing millions to migrate, threatening global security.\nMillions of people across the Middle East, Africa and South Asia have already been forced to move as once fertile land turns to dust and water becomes scarcer, a trend experts say will intensify in coming decades.\nLoss of livelihoods in the area surrounding Lake Chad, which has shrunk by around 90% since the 1960s, has led to local tensions, said Chadian activist Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim.\n\"With resource scarcity, communities move to concentrate around these lakes, especially on the Chadian side. This causes intercommunal conflicts,\" Ibrahim said.\nAchieving UN goals on restoring 1.5 billion hectares of degraded land requires at least $2.6 trillion in total investments by the end of the decade — the equivalent of $1 billion per day, according to a UN financial needs assessment published at the beginning of COP16.\nOn the conference's second day, $12 billion was pledged for land restoration and drought resilience from donors including the Arab Coordination Group — an alliance of development finance institutions — and the Riyadh Global Drought Resilience Partnership. The latter was launched by COP16 hosts Saudi Arabia to leverage public and private finance for 80 of the world's most vulnerable and drought-hit countries.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn the second week of the conference, smaller contributions of $11 million from Italy and $3.6 million from Austria were announced to support the implementation of the Great Green Wall initiative, a land restoration project stretching across Africa.\n\"And as we have seen in the other COPs this year, resource mobilization and finance remain significant challenges,\" said Goodman, referring to the UN climate and biodiversity conferences. He said an annual financing gap of $278 billion remains. \"There is a lot to be done.\"\nThe private sector, which currently contributes 6% of financing for land restoration and drought resilience, needs to play a greater role, said Thiaw.\n\"We are not talking about charity. We are talking about investments, so that the private sector that is producing food or cotton or doing mining, actually invest in their own land.\"\nIt is estimated that restoring over a billion hectares of land could generate up to $1.8 trillion annually through benefits such as increased agricultural productivity.\nGoodman hopes in the final days of negotiations parties will significantly raise ambitions while also recognizing the critical role healthy lands and ecosystems play in achieving goals on climate change and biodiversity loss.\nWhen land is degraded it not only struggles to support plant and animal life but also releases carbon, stored in the soil, into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change.\nSince the UNCCD was created, more than 50 countries have set targets to revive and protect their land.\n\nPlanting trees, rotating crops, improving water retention and applying organic manure or mineral fertilizers are all strategies to help restore land, according to the UNCCD.\nThey have outlined a goal of achieving zero net losses in healthy land — known as land degradation neutrality — by 2030.\n\n\"We also hope to see a process launched to develop an ambitious target, or set of targets, for restoration after 2030 as part of the Convention's next strategy,\" said Goodman.\nWith additional reporting from Kossivi Tiassou in Riyadh\nEdited by: Jennifer Collins"

    "content": "Bribery charges by a US court against the Adani Group are unlikely to significantly upset India's clean energy goals, industry leaders have told the BBC.\nDelhi has pledged to source half of its energy needs or 500 gigawatts (GW) of electricity from renewable sources by 2032, key to global efforts to combat climate change.\nThe Adani Group is slated to contribute to a tenth of that capacity.\nThe legal troubles in the US could temporarily delay the group's expansion plans but will not affect the government's overall targets, analysts say.\nIndia has made impressive strides in building clean energy infrastructure over the last decade.\nThe country is growing at the \"fastest rate among major economies\" in adding renewables capacity, according to the International Energy Agency.\nInstalled clean energy capacity has grown five-fold, with some 45% of the country's power-generation capacity - of nearly 200GW - coming from non-fossil fuel sources.\nCharges against the Adani Group - crucial to India's clean energy ambitions - are \"like a passing dark cloud\", and will not meaningfully impact this momentum, a former CEO of a rival firm said, wanting to remain anonymous.\nGautam Adani has vowed to invest $100bn (£78.3bn) in India's energy transition. Its green energy arm is the country's largest renewable energy company, producing nearly 11GW of clean energy through a diverse portfolio of wind and solar projects.\nAdani has a target to scale that to 50GW BY 2030, which will make up nearly 10% of the country's own installed capacity.\nOver half of that, or 30GW, will be produced at Khavda, in the western Indian state of Gujarat. It is the world's biggest clean energy plant, touted to be five times the size of Paris and the centrepiece in Adani's renewables crown.\nBut Khavda and Adani's other renewables facilities are now at the very centre of the charges filed by US prosecutors - they allege that the company won contracts to supply power to state distribution companies from these facilities, in exchange for bribes to Indian officials. The group has denied this.\nBut the fallout at the company level is already visible.\nWhen the indictment became public, Adani Green Energy immediately cancelled a $600m bond offering in the US.\nFrance's TotalEnergies, which owns 20% of Adani Green Energy and has a joint venture to develop several renewables projects with the conglomerate, said it will halt fresh capital infusion into the company.\nMajor credit ratings agencies - Moody's, Fitch and S&P - have since changed their outlook on Adani group companies, including Adani Green Energy, to negative. This will impact the company's capacity to access funds and make it more expensive to raise capital.\nAnalysts have also raised concerns about Adani Green Energy's ability to refinance its debt, as international lenders grow weary of adding exposure to the group.\nGlobal lenders like Jeffries and Barclays are already said to be reviewing their ties with Adani even as the group's reliance on global banks and international and local bond issues for long-term debt has grown from barely 14% in financial year 2016 to nearly 60% as of date, according to a note from Bernstein.\nJapanese brokerage Nomura says new financing might dry up in the short term but should \"gradually resume in the long term\". Meanwhile, Japanese banks like MUFG, SMBC, Mizuho are likely to continue their relationship with the group.\nThe \"reputational and sentimental impact\" will fade away in a few months, as Adani is building \"solid, strategic assets and creating long-term value\", the unnamed CEO said.\nA spokesperson for the Adani Group told the BBC that it was \"committed to its 2030 targets and confident of delivering 50 GW of renewable energy capacity\".\nAdani stocks have recovered sharply from the lows they hit post the US court indictment.\nSome analysts told the BBC that a possible slowdown in funding for Adani could in fact end up benefitting its competitors.\nWhile Adani's financial influence has allowed it to rapidly expand in the sector, its competitors such as Tata Power, Goldman Sachs-backed ReNew Power, Greenko and state-run NTPC Ltd are also significantly ramping up manufacturing and generation capacity.\n\"It's not that Adani is a green energy champion. It is a big player that has walked both sides of the street, being the biggest private developer of coal plants in the world,\" said Tim Buckley, director at Climate Energy Finance.\nA large entity, \"perceived to be corrupt\" possibly slowing its expansion, could mean \"more money will start flowing into other green energy companies\", he said.\nAccording to Vibhuti Garg, South Asia director at Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA), market fundamentals also continue to remain strong with demand for renewable energy outpacing supply in India - which is likely to keep the appetite for big investments intact.\nWhat could in fact slow the pace of India's clean energy ambitions is its own bureaucracy.\n\"Companies we track are very upbeat. Finance isn't a problem for them. If anything, it is state-level regulations that act as a kind of deterrent,\" says Ms Garg.\nMost state-run power distribution companies continue to face financial constraints, opting for cheaper fossil fuels, while dragging their feet on signing purchase agreements.\nAccording to Reuters, the controversial tender won by Adani was the first major contract issued by state-run Solar Energy Corp of India (SECI) without a guaranteed purchase agreement from distributors.\nSECI's chairman told Reuters that there are 30GW of operational green energy projects in the market without buyers.\nExperts say the 8GW solar contract at the heart of Adani's US indictment also sheds light on the messy tendering process, which required solar power generation companies to manufacture modules as well - limiting the number of bidders and leading to higher power costs.\nThe court indictment will certainly lead to a \"tightening of bidding and tendering rules\", says Ms Garg.\nA cleaner tendering process that lowers risks both for developers and investors will be important going ahead, agrees Mr Buckley.\nFollow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook.\nThousands of protesters celebrated the vote on the streets of Seoul, with singing and fireworks.\nPersistent rain means only 13.2 overs are possible on the opening day of the third Test between Australia and India in Brisbane.\nIndia marks the centenary of Raj Kapoor, who would have turned 100 on Saturday, with celebratory events.\nEngland are no longer in contention but which sides can still qualify for the World Test Championship - and what do they need to make it?\nSunil Devi says she thought Harshita and her son, Pankaj Lamba, were \"happy in their lives\".\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The world is at a turning point, as CO2 emissions could soon stop rising thanks to a renewable energy boom. But according to a new climate protection ranking, countries aren't doing enough to move away from oil and gas.\nRenewable energies are expanding rapidly in high-emissions countries, but too many states are prolonging the use of fossil fuels, particularly gas, according to the latest Climate Change Performance Index, which ranks states' climate protection measures.\n\"The world is at a turning point. Peak of global emissions is closely in sight,\" said Niklas Höhne of German climate policy think tank NewClimate Institute, and a co-author of the report. But states need to act quickly to drastically cut emissions and \"prevent further dangerous consequences of climate change,\" he added.\nThe CCPI, published annually, evaluated the 63 countries plus the European Union that are responsible for 90% of global greenhouse gas emissions.\nOf the countries analyzed, 61 have managed to increase the share of green energy sources, like wind and solar, in their energy mixes over the last five years.\n\"Renewables are in the fast lane, especially in the electricity sector,\" said lead author Jan Burck from environment NGO Germanwatch, on the launch of the CCPI during the UN climate summit in Azerbaijan. \"In addition, there is an increasing electrification of the mobility, residential and industrial sectors. The trend toward electrification is continuing.\"\nStill, 42 countries' current per capita emissions are not aligned with the Paris goal of limiting global average temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 Fahrenheit).\nThe CCPI, said Höhne, shows \"how big the resistance from the fossil fuel lobby is.\"\nIn the US presidential election, this was \"a decisive factor in bringing [Donald] Trump back to the White House,\" said Höhne. The US has experienced a boom in shale gas over the past few years and Trump has promised to further expand domestic fossil fuel production and spend less on clean energy.\nThe countries that ranked worst in the CCPI — Iran, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Russia — are also among the largest oil and gas producers in the world. The share of renewables in their respective energy mixes is under 3%, the analysis found, with the countries showing \"no signs of departing from fossil fuels as a business model.\"\nThe CCPI, put together by experts from Germanwatch, NewClimate Institute and international environment grouping Climate Action Network, ranks countries' progress in cutting carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions and energy use as well as expanding renewables and improving climate policy.\nThe top three spots in the ranking remained unclaimed — as is usually the case — because none of the countries surveyed are doing enough to \"avoid dangerous climate change\" and achieve a \"very high\" rating.\nDenmark once again clinched the number 4 spot, followed by the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, one of the countries with the biggest ranking improvement this year.\nThe UK moved up 14 positions from 2023 due the recent closure of the country's last coal power plant.

    "content": "A cold November, rising gas prices and the likely imminent end to a key pipeline gas contract have prompted concerns that Europe is on the verge of another energy crisis.\nRising gas prices in recent weeks have brought back some bad memories for European energy traders — and governments.\nRecollections are fresh of the problems that hit energy markets following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022. As the continent scrambled to end its dependence on Russian gas, prices soared.\nApart from fueling already rampant inflation, it led to concerns around possible blackouts. Persistently high prices also led to problems for energy-intensive industries, leading to closures and job losses.\nEurope ultimately made it through the last two winters, largely thanks to milder-than-expected weather enabling it to keep energy usage low. However, a cold start to November has contributed to a fresh surge in natural gas prices.\nPrices spiked in November, hitting almost €49 ($51.6) per megawatt-hour (MWh) on November 21, the highest price in over a year.\nThe cold weather has led to more heating being used, and combined with low wind speeds in northern Europe and the resulting fall in renewable supply, gas is in higher demand.\nHowever, prices remain way below the highs seen during 2022, particularly as overall demand for gas has fallen since then. The shock can also be partly explained by the fact that throughout 2024, prices have been far lower than at any time since the war began.\n\"Prices have risen by approximately 40% since mid-September,\" Petras Katinas, an energy analyst at the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) , told DW. \"So it's a pretty huge jump all of a sudden.\"\nThe prospect of a colder winter has led to fears that inventories — fully stocked until recently — could be depleted and fuel a cyclical surge in prices.\nHowever, Katinas says Russia's grip on the European market has weakened greatly since 2022 and that talk of a \"crisis\" is overblown. \"I wouldn't call it crisis, especially if we compare what actually happened in 2022 and 2023,\" he said. \"The majority of the EU member states do not have huge dependency on Russian gas anymore.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBut questions around Russian gas continue to influence the overall picture.\nRussia is far from the behemoth it once was in terms of EU gas supply. The share of Russian pipeline gas imported by member states fell from 40% of the total in 2021, to about 9% in 2023. However, according to recent CREA data, a rise in Russian liquefied natural gas (LNG) into the bloc means it still accounts for 18% of the EU's total gas imports, an increase of almost 5% from 2023.\nUltimately, Russian pipeline gas deliveries to the bloc appear to be coming to the end. Austria, one of the last European countries still receiving pipeline gas from Russia, finally stopped receiving the hydrocarbon after a legal dispute with Gazprom, the state-owned Russian gas company.\nWhile Slovakia and Hungary still receive Russian pipeline gas, all indications suggest the arrangement will run out at the end of 2024. The five-year gas transit deal involving Gazprom and Ukrainian state company Naftogaz for the transit of Russian gas across Ukrainian territory expires at the end of the year and Kyiv says it will not renew it.\nAlthough the TurkStream pipeline will still supply Hungary, the end of flows via Ukraine will put pressure on central European countries to find an alternative supply.\nBorys Dodonov, head of the Center for Energy and Climate Studies at the Kyiv School of Economics, expects the gas transit deal to end because, \"Ukraine has no economic rationale to renew this contract.\"\nIn an interview with DW, Dodonov pointed to the possibility of some kind of alternative deal being done instead. \"We cannot exclude any hidden agreements, or corruption,\" he said, and added that the EU itself could lobby to keep the gas flowing in order to avoid potential shortages in countries such as Slovakia and Hungary.\nRemarkably, despite everything that has happened in the last three years, the EU remains Russia's biggest customer for both pipeline gas and LNG. In October, the EU bought 49% of all Russia's LNG exports and 40% of all its pipeline gas exports.\nSince Russian pipeline gas to Europe was largely cut off in 2022, LNG has become more important for both parties. Russian LNG volumes into the bloc have increased by close to 15%  so far this year.\nDodonov insists that Europe does not need any Russian gas to meet its energy needs, including LNG, due to new LNG capacity coming from the US. He expects incoming US President Donald Trump to increase LNG output and thinks Europe could be primed for a major gas trade deal with the country.\nEd Cox, head of global LNG at independent commodity data provider ICIS, notes that LNG now accounts for 34% of Europe's total gas share since the invasion in 2022, double what it was prior. The pivot to LNG means Europe is now more vulnerable to global price pressures. \"Europe is more connected to fundamentals in a global market than ever before,\" he told DW, even though overall European demand for gas had fallen by around 20% from the pre-invasion period due to high prices, warmer-than-expected weather and increased renewable capacity.\nCox believes that in the event of a cold winter and an end to the Ukraine transit deal, Europe will still be able to meet its gas needs with LNG. However it will come at the risk of much higher prices as supply won't be dramatically increased in the short term. \"Europe will get enough LNG if it needs it. But it might mean that European prices have to go higher to compete with Asian demand.\"\nHigher prices for gas to replenish stocks after the winter, he added, would have a knock-on effect heading for the winter of 2025 and beyond. \"It's not about whether we have enough LNG or gas, it's really about the price implications.\"\nEdited by: Uwe Hessler"

    "content": "California is suing oil and gas major ExxonMobil. The case has highlighted the connection between fossil fuel companies and plastic waste, as well as the need for a cap on plastic production.\nThe idea of 400 million tons is too huge to be easily graspable. Yet that is the volume of virgin plastic produced annually. It is also roughly the weight of the entire human population.\nRegardless of its existing heavyweight footprint, plastic is on track to take up even more space in the world. Current projections suggest today's output will roughly triple by 2060. Currently, an estimated 20 million tons of plastic end up in the environment each year, while annual global recycling rates stand at just 9%.\nFor years, experts and civil society groups have been sounding the alarm on the impossibility of recycling our way out of the growing mountains of plastic waste, calling instead for a cap on production. But for those same years, the wheels of the manufacturing machine have continued to turn — at an ever-giddier pace.\nAnd in an age of booming renewable energy sources, the increasing production volume of virgin plastic, has much to do with the oil and gas industries. The vast majority is made using fossil fuels.\n\"Fossil fuel companies today do not rely on selling gasoline or fuel for energy or transport as a way to stay alive,\" said Delphine Levi Alvares, global petrochemicals campaign manager at the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) in a briefing. \"They are increasingly relying on producing petrochemicals.\"\nWhich ultimately means the companies that have traditionally sold the world its fuel, are now investing in producing ever more plastic. To the tune of tens of billions of dollars.\nReducing production has emerged as a contentious issue during two years of talks to reach a global plastics treaty. Though the final round did not deliver agreement on that point, there are other meaningful moves afoot to force change. Not least via a legal complaint filed earlier this year by the US state of California against oil and gas major ExxonMobil.\nIn the lawsuit, California's Attorney General Rob Bonta alleges that ExxonMobil, the biggest producer of single-use plastics in the world \"aggressively promoted the development of fossil-fuel-based plastic products and campaigned to minimize the public's understanding of the harmful consequences of these products.\"\nAnd as such had \"deceived Californians for almost half a century by promising that recycling could and would solve the ever-growing plastic waste crisis.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nMark James, interim director of the Institute for Energy and the Environment at Vermont Law and Graduate School said that although ExxonMobil does not sell directly to consumers doing their groceries, oil and gas companies have been very intentional in creating markets for the plastic products that go into the shopping basket.\n\"There has definitely been marketing of the recyclability of plastics to those end users,\" he said. \"But it is an industry creation and once we know that, we can understand all the things that they have been doing to maintain that false sense of recyclability of their product.\"\nIn a response to the claim, ExxonMobil said that California officials \"had known their recycling system isn't effective\" and had failed to act. At the time of publication, the company had not responded to a DW request for further comment.\nLevi Alvares sees the California lawsuit as a critical step joining the dots that the broader public does not always see — to make the connection between plastic production and fossil fuel companies.\n\"This kind of lawsuit really cements in people's minds this trend that lots of people haven't been connecting the impact these companies have on the climate crisis to the impact they have in other sectors.\"\nBecause despite the historically low rate of global recycling — just 10% of all plastic ever produced has been turned into something else — and the reality that many products cannot easily be processed into other goods, ExxonMobil is betting on \"advanced recycling.\" This technology, it says \"converts plastic waste back into molecular building blocks,\" meaning they become the raw material for new products.\nThe company says it has used advanced recycling to \"process more than 60 million pounds [27.2 million kilograms] of plastic waste into usable raw materials, keeping it out of landfills.\" And just weeks after California filed its lawsuit, ExxonMobil announced it was expanding its capacity.\nBut the California complaint, which is based on two years of investigation, says even in ExxonMobil's \"best-case scenario,\" advanced recycling will account for a tiny fraction of the plastic the company continues to produce. And is therefore \"nothing more than a public relations stunt meant to encourage the public to keep purchasing single-use plastics that are fueling the plastics pollution crisis.\"\nAdam Herriott, senior specialist at global environmental action NGO WRAP says from their position at the very start of the plastic supply chain, fossil fuel companies \"significantly impact the volume of plastic entering the market,\" and that \"by actively participating in efforts to reduce virgin plastic production, they can help drive systemic change.\"\nYet like other leading fossil fuel, petrochemical and fast-moving consumer goods companies, ExxonMobil is a member of the independent global non-profit Alliance to End Plastic Waste (AEPW), which works to tackle plastic once it has become waste rather than addressing the issue through reduced production.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIn an email to DW, a spokesperson for the Alliance said its mandate mainly focuses on developing \"solutions that support the collection, sorting, and recycling of plastic waste to promote a circular economy for plastic.\" The statement added that AEPW believes \"it is the sum of the work of the multiple stakeholders — from upstream to downstream solutions — that will help solve the challenge.\"\nThere is plenty riding on California's case against ExxonMobil.Not just whether the company will be ordered to meet California's demands, which include monetary damages, and for the company to stop making misleading claims, but whether it leads to similar actions elsewhere that could try to force the hand of fossil fuel companies through the courts.\nPatrick Boyle, corporate accountability attorney with CIEL, says he expects to see more such cases in the US, and even beyond because evidence and testimony presented in the context of the Exxon suit — which is likely to play out over a matter of years — will become public record.\n\"It may not look exactly like this like litigation against Exxon with these specific claims,\" he said, but collected evidence could potentially be leveraged to fight other cases around issues like microplastics, greenwashing or permits for advanced recycling. \n\n\"So, I think there's a lot of really interesting conversations and brainstorming to have and begin having with partners to see how do we leverage what we get here, in the international context.\" \n\nIn the meantime, Levi Alvares says the complaint against Exxon is strengthening the understanding that plastic waste is a problem \"engineered by industry.\"\n\nEdited by: Sarah Steffen, Jennifer Collins\n\nThis article was amended to attribute the statement from the AEPW to an Alliance spokesperson as opposed to a specific individual, and reflect the failure of talks on the terms of a global plastic agreement."

    "content": "While pro-Israel views are common in US politics, Trump’s picks signal support for far-right Israeli aspirations.\nDuring the final weeks of the 2024 United States presidential race, former President Donald Trump spoke with sympathy to Arab American and Muslim voters enraged by the country’s support for Israel’s wars in Gaza and Lebanon.\nTrump visited Dearborn, Michigan, known as the “capital” of Arab America. And he spoke directly to Lebanese Americans fearing for their families overseas.\n\n\n\n\n“During my Administration, we had peace in the Middle East, and we will have peace again very soon!” Trump wrote on social media.\n“I will fix the problems caused by [Vice President] Kamala Harris and [President] Joe Biden and stop the suffering and destruction in Lebanon. I want to see the Middle East return to real peace, a lasting peace.”\nBut following a thumping victory at the polls, Trump is preparing to return to the White House with a coterie of some of the Republican Party’s most vehemently pro-Israel figures.\nWhile some critics speculated that Trump would move away from a hawkish foreign policy, his picks for key administration and cabinet positions have signalled that — whatever changes may come during his second term — a break with Israel is not likely to be among them.\nSeveral of Trump’s nominees not only support continued US military and diplomatic assistance for Israel, but also echo the views and goals of Israeli ultranationalists, who support the expansion of illegal Israeli settlements into Palestinian territory.\nMeanwhile, the war in Gaza continues to drive civilian casualties, with at least 43,799 killed since the conflict began in October 2023. A recent report from a United Nations special committee found that Israel’s methods in the Palestinian enclave were “consistent with genocide“.\nWhat have Trump’s high-level picks said about the ongoing conflict in the Middle East? Here are a few of his nominees, in their own words.\nA longtime foreign policy hawk, Senator Marco Rubio of Florida has been a strong supporter of Israel throughout his political career. He is in line to be secretary of state, the US’s top diplomat.\nFebruary 26, 2016: Rubio made a bid for president in 2016, facing a crowded pool of Republican candidates including Trump. At a Republican primary debate in Houston, Texas, he emphasised that he would “stand firmly on the side of Israel” — and used his position to draw a contrast with Trump.\nOctober 9, 2023: Rubio reacted to the October 7 attacks in southern Israel by calling for an overwhelming military response.\nNovember 2024: Confronted with activists from the antiwar group Code Pink, Rubio responded forcefully to questions about whether he would support a ceasefire in Gaza.\nAugust 30, 2024: Rubio sent a letter to the outgoing administration of President Joe Biden criticising the decision to sanction Israeli settlers linked to anti-Palestinian violence in the occupied West Bank.\nA US Army veteran who deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan, Fox News host Pete Hegseth has been tapped to head the Department of Defense, in one of the country’s highest-ranking military positions. If Hegseth is confirmed, only the president himself would have more authority over the armed forces.\nSeptember 14, 2016: In an interview with the Jewish Press, Hegseth explained that he grew up a Baptist and never met a Jewish person until attending college. But he accused higher education of spreading the “seeds of anti-Semitism”.\nFebruary 2018: Speaking at the Arutz Sheva Conference in Jerusalem, Hegseth pledged to continue “fighting the fake news about the Arab-Israeli conflict”.\nHe also appeared to endorse demolishing the Al-Aqsa Mosque, one of the holiest sites in Islam, to make room for a “Third Temple”, a longstanding goal of Israeli ultranationalists and evangelical Christians.\nMay 2018: Speaking with his co-hosts on the TV programme Fox & Friends, Hegseth appeared to brush off the Palestinian death toll during the Great March of Return protests. When confronted with the possibility that Israeli snipers had fired on “innocent people”, including children, Hegseth shrugged and said, “Meh.”\nA former Arkansas governor who unsuccessfully ran for president in 2008 and 2016, Mike Huckabee is an evangelical Christian and strong supporter of “Greater Israel”, a term often used to describe the proposed Israeli annexation of Palestinian territory.\nEarly 2008: At a campaign stop during his first bid for the presidency, Huckabee argued that being Palestinian was a made-up identity.\nMay 31, 2015: Speaking at an Israel Day concert, Huckabee reflected on his first trip to Israel in 1973. He proceeded to say that Israel had no “better friend in the United States” than him and refuted Palestinian claims to Jerusalem.\nAugust 18, 2015: During a news conference at the illegal Israeli settlement of Shiloh, Huckabee endorsed a vision of Israel that included the occupied West Bank, calling the area by the biblical name “Judea and Samaria”. He also denounced a deal to contain Iran’s nuclear programme.\nFebruary 29, 2024: Huckabee told the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews that he was overwhelmed with emotion after the October 7 attacks on southern Israel. He also described Israel’s illegal settlements in the West Bank as the fulfilment of biblical prophecy.\nA congresswoman from New York, Stefanik went viral last year during congressional hearings about anti-Semitism on college campuses: Her blunt questioning of several university leaders helped precipitate several resignations.\nCritics say it also contributed to harsh crackdowns on pro-Palestine student demonstrators, as Stefanik conflated protest slogans like “From the River to the Sea” with calls for anti-Semitic genocide.\nMay 19, 2024: Stefanik travelled to the Israeli Knesset to deliver an address in which she described Israel’s war on Gaza as a moral crusade. She also called for the withdrawal of US funds from UNRWA, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees.\nSeptember 23, 2024: Following a UN General Assembly vote calling on Israel to end its unlawful occupation of Palestinian territory, Stefanik released a statement condemning the proceedings.\nA member of the House of Representatives and a former Green Beret, Representative Mike Waltz of Florida has expressed firm support for Israel. He currently serves on the House Armed Services Committee. He previously chided the Biden administration for providing Israel with insufficient support.\nAugust 16, 2019: In an appearance on Fox News, Waltz expressed his support for Israel’s decision to bar his congressional colleagues Rashida Tlaib and Ilhan Omar from entering the country over their support for the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions (BDS) movement.\nTlaib, a Palestinian American, was later offered a “humanitarian” visit, which she rejected.\nAugust 17, 2024: In another interview with Fox News, Waltz approvingly noted that, when Trump was in office, the Iranian economy was “broke” and was “in shambles” due to crushing sanctions.\nHe also credited Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s “strong actions” with containing the threat represented by Iran and its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC).\nOctober 25, 2024: Following Israeli strikes on Iran, Waltz noted in a social media post that Israel had avoided targeting oil fields and nuclear facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "This video can not be played\nWATCH: Irish police stop a bus that has crossed the border from Northern Ireland\nThe three Gardai - Irish police officers - walk down the rows of passengers on the bus, a few kilometres south of the border with Northern Ireland.\nObserving this is the head of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, Det Ch Supt Aidan Minnock.\nâIf they don't have status to be in Ireland, we bring them to Dublin,â he explains. âThey're removed on a ferry back to the UK on the same day.â\nAsylum applications in Ireland have risen by nearly 300% so far this year compared to the same period five years ago. A spike in arrivals from the UK has been driven by various factors, among these the UKâs tougher stance post-Brexit, including the fear of deportations to Rwanda, as well as Irelandâs relatively healthy economy.\nMost asylum seekers coming from the UK to the Republic of Ireland enter the country from Northern Ireland, as - unlike the airport or ferry routes - there is no passport control. The Garda checks along the 500km-long (310 miles) border are the only means of stopping illegal entry.\nDet Ch Supt Minnock told the BBC that 200 people had been returned to the UK this year as a result of these checkpoints, thought to be only a small fraction of those crossing the porous border illegally.\nMore than 2,000 people who arrived in Ireland illegally have been issued deportation orders so far this year, a 156% increase on the same period in 2023. However, only 129 of those people (just over 6%) are confirmed to have since left the state. The government has said it will begin chartered deportation flights in the coming months, and free up more immigration Gardai from desk work.\nDet Ch Supt Aidan Minnock says he understands what motivates people to seek asylum\nOnboard the coach near the border, the Gardai question a young man about where he lives. He is Algerian - a student, he says. The police are suspicious and he is taken to the detention vehicle while his identity is checked.\nA veteran of war crimes investigations in post-war Bosnia - as part of an EU police team - Det Ch Supt Minnock knows well the violence and poverty that drives migration.\nâThis is growing at such a scale because of the conflict and instability right across the world,â he says.\nPublic concern over immigration is closely linked to Irelandâs chronic housing problem. The Republic now has the worst record in the EU for housing young people.\nThe CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, Nick Henderson, says the crisis is a âperfect stormâ, created in part by the failure to build enough housing stock over decades, and a government unprepared for the upsurge in asylum seekers - known in Ireland as International Protection Applicants (IPAs) - needing help with accommodation.\nâ[The government] is only able to provide accommodation through private contractors. That, coupled with an increase in the number of people seeking protection in Ireland, and against the background of a housing crisis has meant, in effect, that Ireland's asylum reception system has really collapsed.â\nIn nearly three years, the number of asylum seekers accommodated by the stateâs International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) has more than quadrupled - from 7,244 to 32,649 people. Over 100,000 Ukrainians, who were given a separate status, also sought refuge in Ireland during that time.\nTens of thousands of international protection applicants - some already with asylum status in Ireland, others waiting to be processed - have been sent to communities around the country, accommodated in hotels, former schools, apartments, even large tented camps.\nIrelandâs housing shortage means that even those granted asylum are struggling to leave the temporary system as others arrive. Nearly 1,000 people are now living in tented accommodation.\nRows of tents housing asylum seekers pitched along Dublin's Grand Canal in May this year\nThis makeshift response has generated resentment. In the village of Dundrum, County Tipperary - population 221 - a group of locals attempted to block the arrival of asylum seekers at the gates of a former hotel in August. The proposal to house up to 277 people at Dundrum House, which hasnât operated as a hotel since 2015, would double the local population. Locals worry that it will be a permanent fixture.\nâHow can our government not engage properly with us?â asks Andrea Crowe, a local teacher and protester who has frequently spoken in public. She cites concerns over housing, health and education provision for the community.\nProtester Andrea Crowe feels the government failed to consult with the community before sending the asylum seekers to Dundrum House\nThe protest outside Dundrum House has been there for more than 180 days\nSince July, there has been a 24-hour protest outside the hotel. Ms Crowe, whose family once owned the Dundrum House hotel, accuses the government of failing to consult with the community - a common complaint around the country.\nâHow can we not be concerned?â she says.\nThe IPAS community currently living at Dundrum House is made up of about 80 women and children. There is also a separate group of Ukrainian families, welcomed after the Russian invasion in February 2022.\nSeveral locals told us they feared that single men - who make up 35% of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland so far this year - would eventually replace the women and children, although there so far is no evidence to suggest this is planned in Dundrum.\nLocal builder, Martin Barry, cites the housing crisis as a key reason for his protest, particularly the plight of his eldest son. âMy own young fella, he can't afford a place to rent,â he says.\nMartin Barry is one of a rotating group of about a dozen people who have been protesting outside Dundrum House\nBut Martin Barry also speaks to deeper fears of change in some rural communities. The dance hall where he met his wife has closed. The local pub is for sale. There were hopes Dundrum House would be reopened and used by the local community.\nâItâs just the worry of what's coming down the line,â he says.\nWe meet two South African women given refuge at Dundrum House. Both were sent from their accommodation in Dublin - 180km (110 miles) away - to make way for newer arrivals into the capital, some of whom were sleeping in tents on the streets.\nThe women ask to remain anonymous. âLeratoâ had been in Dublin for a year. âI had integrated with society, and made friends. My child was attending school and I was comfortable.â Her friend âKaylaâ speaks of being isolated in Dundrum, a farming community with limited transport amenities.\nThese two women say they were moved to Dundrum from Dublin at five hours' notice\nFar-right parties show scant support in opinion polls. Immigration worries are likely to be expressed in support for independent candidates. But online, far-right agitators stoke fear. There have been violent riots and arson attacks on sites meant to house, or rumoured to house, asylum seekers, and refugees have been attacked in their tents on Dublinâs streets.\nA common conspiracy theory is that migrants are being âplantedâ in Ireland as part of a plot to dominate Irish people and destroy their culture.\nWe saw two posters referring to a âplantationâ at the Dundrum House protest. The now-closed online GoFundMe Page for Dundrum referred to Irelandâs âindigenousâ population fighting âfor our very existenceâ and the government âflooding communities with asylum seekersâ.\nThe page - which raised more than â¬3,000 (Â£2,500) - was set up by a local businessman. He turns out to have posted antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-vaccine conspiracist material on social media.\nWe ask Andrea Crowe, one of the prominent voices of the Dundrum protest, if she is comfortable with such a person being involved? Ms Crowe says she does not âfollow social media muchâ and it is not up to her to manage other peopleâs reactions. But she says sheâs ânot comfortable with itâ.\nâStop the immigration plantation of Irelandâ reads one poster at Dundrum\nOthers in County Tipperary welcome asylum seekers. Some 17 groups came together under the slogan âTipperary Welcomesâ after the Dundrum protest began.\nJohn Browne, a member of the community council, says the issue divides people. âI donât have a problem with it because we're relatively wealthy, and the situation is pretty bad in parts of Africa and where most of these people are coming from.â\nBut he disagrees strongly with the numbers involved in small places like Dundrum. âIt imbalances the community. And it's no good for the people coming in, because there's nothing here for them.â\nWe caught up with Irelandâs Minister for Integration, Roderic OâGorman, while he was campaigning in Dublin for the General Election, due to be held on 29 November. He now canvasses votes with two police guards after being assaulted by a man protesting against immigration.\nIrelandâs Minister for Integration, Roderic OâGorman, says the state is engaging more with local communities\nMr OâGorman says many areas welcome asylum seekers.\nâThere are communities all over the place who are actually embracing and supporting,â he says.\nBut he accepts some failures. âI recognise in the initial parts of our response, there were times where there wasn't that level of engagement that we need,â he says.\nThere are now Community Engagement Teams responsible for liaising with residents, although the protesters we spoke to in Dundrum say they have had only one meeting with a team and are still no wiser about the long-term plans for the hotel.\nThe dance hall in Dundrum has now closed - the village pub is for sale\nOfficial policy is hardening. Ukrainian asylum seekers who arrived amid widespread public sympathy and were given special benefits, recently saw these slashed from â¬232 (Â£190) to â¬38.80 (Â£32) per week - a cut of 83%.\nSouth Africans now need visas to enter the country. A visa loophole which allowed Jordanians - at one point the largest group of asylum seekers in Ireland - to enter from the UK has been closed.\nConcern over immigration has so far not translated into electoral support for far-right parties. Nick Henderson at the Refugee Council believes this need not be inevitable in Ireland. âCommunities want to welcome people, but they need resources. They need communication.â\nThe Republicâs image as a stable and progressive democracy wonât change in this electoral cycle. But the rise in far-right populism internationally is a warning for the future â of how concern over immigration can be made a focus for other discontents and create turbulent politics.\nIreland's view of immigration one year since Dublin riots\nWhat is the Great Reset?\nListen to \"The Great Replacement Theory\" on BBC Sounds\nSouth Korea parliament votes to impeach president\nUK 'doesn't have enough builders' for Labour's 1.5m homes\n'I felt like a breathing corpse': Stories from people freed from Syria torture prison\nThe dark fandom behind healthcare CEO murder suspect\nQuestions over Andrew's judgement and finances raised again\n'I wasn't me any more' - a photographer tackles her postnatal depression\n'Train phone snatcher stole Â£21,000 from my bank apps'\nWhat lies ahead for Assad and his family?\n'It's life limiting': Living with a diagnosable hatred of fidgeting\nGirl group Flo: 'British R&B acts struggle to be heard'\nWeekly quiz: Which film bagged the most Golden Globe nominations?\nTrump says Syria 'not our fight'.

    "content": "Trump begins his second presidential term in January and has told NBC he will issue a range of new executive orders\nPresident-elect Donald Trump has vowed to end automatic citizenship for anyone born in the US, starting on his first day back in office next month.\n\"We have to end it. It's ridiculous,\" he told NBC's Meet the Press in his first broadcast network interview since winning November's election.\nAttempts to do so would face significant hurdles, however, as it is enshrined in the US Constitution.\nIn the wide-ranging interview, recorded on Friday, Trump also said he would pardon those involved in the 2021 Capitol riot and promised to issue \"a lot\" of executive orders on day one, including on the economy, energy, and immigration.\nThe Republican also reiterated his mass deportation plans for undocumented immigrants living in the US, but offered to work with Democrats to help those who arrived as children.\nWhile he suggested he would not seek a justice department investigation into Joe Biden after he is inaugurated on 20 January, he said that some of his political adversaries, including lawmakers who investigated the Capitol riot, should be jailed.\nTrump was asked whether he would seek to pardon the hundreds of people convicted of involvement in that riot, when supporters of his stormed Congress three months after his defeat in the 2020 election.\n\"We're going to look at independent cases,\" he said. \"Yeah, but I'm going to be acting very quickly.\"\n\"First day,\" he added.\nTrump continued: \"You know, by the way, they've been in there for years, and they're in a filthy, disgusting place that shouldn't even be allowed to be open.\"\nThe president-elect made other news in the NBC interview aired on Sunday:\nHe offered a caveat on whether he would keep the US in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (Nato): \"If they're paying their bills, and if I think they're doing a fair - they're treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely, I'd stay with Nato\"\nTrump said he would not seek to impose restrictions on abortion pills, though when asked to make a guarantee, he added: \"Well, I commit. I mean... things change\"\nThe Republican said Ukraine should \"probably\" expect less aid when he returns to the White House\nTrump said he thinks \"somebody has to find out\" if there is a link between autism and childhood vaccines - an idea that has been ruled out by multiple studies around the world. Trump suggested his nominee for health secretary, vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr, would look into the matter\nThe president-elect repeated his promise that he will not seek to cut Social Security, nor raise its eligibility age, though he said he would make it \"more efficient\", without offering further details\nPressed on whether his plan to impose tariffs on imports from major US trading partners would raise consumer prices for Americans, he said: \"I can't guarantee anything. I can't guarantee tomorrow\"\nOn the subject of immigration, Trump told NBC he would seek through executive action to end so-called birthright citizenship, which entitles anyone born in the US to an American passport, even if their parents were born elsewhere.\nBirthright citizenship stems from the 14th Amendment of the US Constitution, which states that \"all persons born\" in the United States \"are citizens of the United States\".\nThough he has vowed to end the practice, attempts to do so would face significant legal hurdles, and any executive order attempting to do so would likely immediately be overturned in court.\nThe bar to amend the Constitution is extremely high and requires approval from two-thirds of Congress, in both the House and Senate. It must also be ratified by three-fourths of states.\nIn the interview, Trump also said he would follow through on his campaign pledge to deport undocumented immigrants, including those with family members who are US citizens.\n\"I don't want to be breaking up families,\" he said, \"so the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back.\"\nA quick guide to Donald Trump\nWhen will Donald Trump take office as president?\nHow Trump pulled off an incredible comeback\nTrump also said he wants to work with Congress to help \"Dreamers\", undocumented immigrants who were shielded under an Obama-era programme, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Trump once attempted to scrap.\n\"I will work with the Democrats on a plan,\" he said, adding that some of these immigrants have found good jobs and started businesses.\nTrump seemed to offer mixed signals on whether he would follow through on his repeated vows to seek retribution against political adversaries.\nOutgoing US President Joe Biden this week issued a sweeping pardon to his criminally convicted son, Hunter. The Democrat is reported to be considering other blanket pardons for political allies before he leaves office next month.\nTrump seemed to indicate that he would not seek a special counsel investigation into Biden and his family, as he once vowed.\n\"I'm not looking to go back into the past,\" he said. \"I'm looking to make our country successful. Retribution will be through success.\"\nBut he also said that members of the now-defunct, Democratic-led House of Representatives committee that investigated him \"should go to jail\".\nOne member of the panel, former Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney, hit back at Trump on Sunday.\nShe said his comment that members of the committee should be jailed was a \"continuation of his assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our republic\".\nIn his NBC interview Trump also said he would not direct the FBI to pursue investigations against his foes.\nBut he told the network: \"If they were crooked, if they did something wrong, if they have broken the law, probably.\n\"They went after me. You know, they went after me, and I did nothing wrong.\"\nWhat Trump could do on day one in the White House\nHow undocumented migrants feel about deportations\nWho has joined Trump's top team?\n\nNorth America correspondent Anthony Zurcher makes sense of US politics in his twice weekly US Election Unspun newsletter.

    "content": "Diplomatic tensions and stricter immigration policies are hitting education consultants and students in India.\nKolkata, India – For the past several years, Manpreet Singh has been dreaming of going abroad for higher studies.\nThe 22-year-old Sikh, a resident of Moradabad in Uttar Pradesh state, chose Canada as his destination as that is where many of the Sikh diaspora is settled.\n\n\n\n\nBut the current diplomatic tension between India and Canada has put a damper on those plans, leaving him disappointed. Singh is now planning to go to Europe and complete his education.\n“Canada was always on the top of my list for foreign education as several people of our community are settled there, and I would have felt at home there. I had convinced my parents to send me, but they have now refused due to the present turmoil between the two countries,” he said.\nHis father, Inderjeet Singh, told Al Jazeera that his son’s safety is his top priority. “We also want our child to get a good education, and I had agreed to his Canada plan. But the current situation has made me rethink, and I prefer to send him to a safer country,” he said.\nSeveral students from India, especially the northern states of Punjab and Haryana, who had been aspiring to go to Canada for higher education, have put their plans on hold due to the escalating tension between the two countries over the killing last year of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, a Canadian Sikh involved with the Sikh independence movement, commonly known as the Khalistan movement, that calls for an independent Sikh state.\nNijjar was shot dead by two masked gunmen in Surrey, British Columbia, in western Canada last year in June.\nSince then, Ottawa has said New Delhi staged the attack on Canadian soil and has even accused Indian Minister of Home Affairs Amit Shah of being behind a campaign of violence and intimidation targeting Sikh activists.\nIt has also expelled several Indian diplomats, including as recently as in October in the latest round of this political face-off, resulting in similar retaliatory actions.\nPolitical repercussions apart, the tension between the two countries has come as a major blow to several thousand Indian students who aspire to go to Canada for undergraduate and postgraduate courses every year.\nThe situation has also affected education and immigration consultants, who depend on these students for their livelihood and charge anywhere between 50,000 rupees ($594) to 500,000 rupees ($5,945) depending upon the country and the university selection, and help students in the application and documentation process.\nOf the more than 1.3 million Indian students studying abroad in 2024, Canada tops the position with 427,000 – which is 41 percent of total international students in Canada.\nThe United States has 337,000 students, the United Kingdom has 185,000 students, and Germany hosts 42,997 Indian students, as per data from the Ministry of External Affairs.\nPratibha Jain, the founder of Eduabroad, a consultancy which for the past three decades has helped students get admission into some of the top universities across the globe, told Al Jazeera that there has been about a 10 percent decline in queries for Canada and the trend has been shifting to other countries instead including the UK, Australia, Dubai and in Europe.\n\n\n\nApart from the current tension, Canada’s domestic political and economic situation is also deterring foreign students.\nIn January, the Canadian government announced an intake cap on international student permit applications for the next two years, citing pressure on housing, healthcare and other services. The cap is expected to reduce by 35 percent the student intake in 2024 as compared to 2023, and which will be followed by an additional 10 percent reduction in 2025.\nGurtej Singh Sandhu, an education consultant based in Chandigarh, estimates that there are more than 150,000 educational and immigration consultancies in the northern states of Punjab, Haryana and Delhi generating an annual turnover of about 12 billion rupees ($142.42m) and many reliant on sending students to Canada for a vast chunk of their revenue.\n“The business of education consultancy from Canada has come down to just 20-25 percent and several consultancies have been forced to close their operations”, Sandhu said.\nTo be fair, the student visa has so far also been a route for many international students to settle in Canada as graduates of Canadian universities could apply for what is known as an open work permit, allowing them to work across sectors, including in jobs that had no connection with their studies.\nAny spouses could also get a visa, allowing them to work. This open plan had helped spawn several educational institutions, including private career colleges offering courses in collaboration with public sector colleges, of vastly varying calibre.\nNow, the Justin Trudeau government has barred private and public-private colleges from issuing open work permits and has only allowed postgraduate students studying in public colleges and universities to get these permits.\nSpouse permits allowing them to work are continuing. These changes “are further deterring Indians from moving to Canada,” Sandhu said.\nThe Guaranteed Investment Certificate (GIC) fee, a mandatory liquid investment in banks in Canada for international students, has also more than doubled to $20,635 since January, further deterring Indian students.\nManinder Singh Arora, founder of Apexvisas, a Pune-based immigration and visa consultancy, told Al Jazeera that Canada’s housing shortage and the high cost of living have also forced students to rethink their plans.\n“The demand for Canada is not over, but it has obviously decreased to a much extent,” Arora said.\n“We have sent around 55 students to Canada this year as compared to 80 last year. The high expenses and negativity about the country in terms of housing and political issues have been contributing to the downfall,” he explained.\nManan Gupta, a regulated Canadian immigration consultant (RCIC) in Brampton, a Toronto suburb popular with Indians, told Al Jazeera that while international students contributed around $37.3bn to the country’s gross domestic product (GDP) in 2022, it was necessary to reduce their numbers “as the infrastructure in Canada is yet to match the high influx of people coming from outside and using education as a backdoor to take up jobs and settle here.”\n“Most of the parents will also deter to send their children in a country where there no diplomats to handle any untoward situation,” he added.\nThe future of immigration in Canada, he said, would depend on the poll outcomes as elections are due by October.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFollow Al Jazeera English:"

    "content": "Follow:\nThe incoming Trump administration’s plans to implement strict border measures, strike down Biden-era policies and kick off the detention and deportation of migrants at large scale are underway and starting to come into focus, according to four sources familiar with the plans.\nPresident-elect Donald Trump made immigration a central element of his 2024 presidential campaign – but unlike his first run, which was spent largely focused on building a border wall, he’s turned his attention to interior enforcement and the removal of undocumented immigrants already in the United States.\nPeople close to the president and his aides are laying the groundwork for expanding detention facilities to fulfill his mass deportation campaign promise, including reviewing metropolitan areas where capabilities exist. But they are also preparing executive actions that are a call back to his first term in office and could be rolled out as soon as Trump takes office, sources say.\nTaken together, it amounts to the return of hardline immigration policies that garnered fierce criticism from Democrats and immigrant advocates during Trump’s first term – and a dramatic change for migrants and immigrants in the United States.\nThe executive actions and reviews underway include the return of the program informally known as “remain in Mexico,” which requires migrants to stay in Mexico during their immigration proceedings in the US, revising asylum restrictions, revoking protections for migrants covered by Biden’s humanitarian parole programs and undoing ICE’s enforcement priorities, according to two sources briefed on transition policy discussions.\nAnother executive order that is being considered would make detention mandatory and call for an end to releasing migrants, which often happens across administrations because of limited federal resources. It’s that type of executive order, sources say, that would pave the way for detaining and eventually, deporting people at a large scale.\nRelated article\nA little-known law from 1798 could be a key part of Trump’s deportation plans\nTrump’s team is also reviewing regional capability for housing migrants – a process likely to lead to consideration of the construction of new detention facilities in larger metropolitan areas, according to two sources. Homeland Security officials have previously identified multiple cities in which to build up detention capability in preparation for border surges.\nPlans also include bringing back family detention, which has been widely criticized by immigrant advocates and a practice that President Joe Biden ended.\n“The American people re-elected President Trump by a resounding margin giving him a mandate to implement the promises he made on the campaign trail. He will deliver,” Trump-Vance transition spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt told CNN in a statement.\nBut key to any plan is money. In the absence of additional congressional funding, people working on the plans have cited the reprogramming of agency funds to shore up resources, as previous administrations have done.\nBut they are also evaluating a potential national emergency declaration to unlock Pentagon resources – which was done during Trump’s first term and faced lawsuits – and tailoring that declaration to pave the way for expanding detention space, according to one of the sources.\nThe private sector, which the federal government heavily relies on for detention space, is also preparing to add more beds. In a recent eaomrnings call, CoreCivic CEO Damon Hininger noted the increased need for detention capacity. CoreCivic is one of the largest private prison operators in the US.\n“We think that the outcome of this election is probably going to be notable for ICE for a couple of different reasons. One is that we do think that there’s going to be increased need for detention capacity,” Hininger told investors.\nThe federal government also works with county jails – and the Trump team is expected to rely on them to find additional space for undocumented immigrants.\nThe team who will be charged with seeing that through has come into shape including veteran immigration official Tom Homan as “border czar,” immigration hardliner Stephen Miller as deputy chief of staff for policy, and loyalist South Dakota Gov. Kristi Noem to head the Department of Homeland Security.\nMiller has previously described plans that include large staging facilities near the border to detain and deport migrants, and worksite raids, which the Biden administration discontinued in 2021.\nBehind the scenes, other border security officials are also involved in discussions, including ex-US Border Patrol Chief Rodney Scott, and Michael Banks, a special adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on the border, according to two of the sources.\nThe people shaping operational plans are well versed on the immigration system, particularly Homan, who was also the architect of family separation. He’s repeatedly stressed that operations will be targeted and focused on public safety and national security threats.\nCurrent and former Homeland Security officials have privately argued that the selection of Homan indicates a level of seriousness by the incoming administration because of his familiarity with immigration enforcement. He also held a senior role at Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the record level of deportations under the Obama administration.\n“(In the) first few days you’ll see those executive orders come out to stem the flow (of migrants) and impact that flow that’s coming during that time. The immediate focus is about who’s already here,” according to a source familiar with the plans. “Those are the first two things prioritized in the first few days.”\nDuring his first term, Trump deported more than 1.5 million people, according to Kathleen Bush-Joseph, a policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. But that’s about half the 2.9 million deportations undertaken during Barack Obama’s first term and fewer than the 1.9 million deportations during Obama’s second term.\nThose figures do not include the millions of people turned away at the border under a Covid-era policy enacted by Trump and used during most of Biden’s term.\n“What he’s trying to accomplish is really complex,” a former administration official told CNN, referring to Homan.\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

But Wall Street doesn’t believe the looming immigration crackdown will live up to Trump’s campaign trail hype.\nAlthough investors expect immigration will slow significantly during Trump’s second administration, just 6% of investors expect net immigration (the difference between the number of people entering and those leaving a region) will turn negative under Trump, according to a Goldman Sachs survey released Sunday.\nIn other words, Wall Street is betting that, even with Trump’s promised crackdown, more people will enter the United States than are deported from it. That would come as a relief to the business owners who warn that wide-scale deportations of millions of people, as Trump has repeatedly promised to enact, will starve them of workers and lift prices on consumers.\nThe findings underscore the reality that deportations will likely be slowed by legal obstacles and logistical constraints, not to mention the economic risk of causing worker shortages at farms, construction sites and elsewhere.\nNearly half of the investors anticipate annual immigration will average between 500,000 and 1 million under Trump, according to Goldman Sachs. That would be down from the recent annualized rate of about 1.75 million and the peak of 3 million last year.\nThe Wall Street bank found that more than 20% of investors expect immigration under Trump will be above the pre-pandemic pace of 1 million per year.\n“Our forecast is only moderately below the pre-pandemic trend because there are legal and logistical limits to executive action,” Goldman Sachs economists led by Jan Hatzius wrote in the report.\nThe president has some authority to control immigration by executive action, but those orders lack the scope and permanence of legislation. Although the House of Representatives and Senate will be under Republican control next year, the party’s margins will be narrow, which could make legislating – particularly on a hot-button topic like immigration – potentially difficult.\nThere’s also significant skepticism among investors about Elon Musk’s promise to severely slash government spending. Trump tapped the tech billionaire to help lead the new Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE, a nongovernmental entity charged with dismantling bureaucracy and cutting wasteful spending.\nJust about 10% of investors expect the Musk-led commission will be able to reduce government spending by more than $400 billion a year, Goldman Sachs found. Nearly 10% expect DOGE will cut spending by $200 billion to $400 billion.\nYet even those figures would pale in comparison with Musk’s lofty goals.\nIn October, Musk was asked by Trump transition team co-chair Howard Lutnick at a rally how much he could cut out of the federal government’s $6.5 trillion budget.\n“Well, I think we could do at least $2 trillion,” Musk replied at the campaign rally, held at Madison Square Garden in New York City. “Your money is being wasted, and the Department of Government Efficiency is going to fix that.”\nYet a plurality of investors – 42% – expect insignificant or very modest spending cuts, according to Goldman Sachs.\nExperts have said it will be very challenging to get to Musk’s spending cut goal without touching entitlement programs like Social Security, cutting defense spending or eating into interest payments.\nFormer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said last month that Musk would be lucky to even find $200 billion in budget cuts because the scope for curbing waste is limited.\n“It’s just mathematically impossible to find $2 trillion,” Glenn Hubbard, a former economic adviser to George W. Bush and former dean of Columbia University’s Business School, said during the same Economic Club of New York event.\nOf course, it’s almost never been smart to bet against Musk, the world’s richest person. And some business leaders are excited by his ambitious goals.\n“Elon Musk, the Edison of our era, could revolutionize government through DOGE,” Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff said in a recent X post. “Imagine $2T in savings, a leaner, smarter system & a future-ready nation.”\nInvestors are also imagining higher tariffs, and the potential side effects from Trump’s promised trade agenda.\nTariffs have emerged as the No. 1 fear among investors, according to the Goldman Sachs survey.\nAsked what 2025 policy concerns them the most, 60% picked the impact of larger tariffs on inflation, economic growth and stocks. The next-closest risk, at 20%, was the risk that tax and spending measures will provoke fiscal sustainability concerns and the inflation consequences of deportations.\nEven if investors are wary of tariffs, they are not exactly panicking. On the first day of trading after Trump’s new threats of massive tariffs on China, Russia and other BRICS nations, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were on track to finish at record highs on Monday.\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

    "content": "When the migrants cross the Mexican border and enter Jim and Sue Chilton’s ranch, they go one of two ways. Those in civilian clothes head west, looking for Border Patrol officers to hand themselves in and request asylum, the couple said. Others, in camo fatigues and carrying large backpacks, go north.\nThey wear slippers made of carpet over their shoes to make it harder to be tracked. They steer clear of roads, instead choosing grueling treks up and down rocky ravines through mesquite trees and shrubs to get where they are going.\nThe Chiltons know they have been there because their journeys have been captured on hidden cameras the couple set up during the Obama administration. They say government agents have told them the backpacks often contain illegal drugs like fentanyl or cocaine. But the couple say they’ve been told that most of these smugglers are not caught. They become known as “gotaways” because they were spotted approaching the border and then, literally, got away.\nBut the Chiltons, and others here in this sparsely populated wilderness west of I-19, believe that is going to change.\nRanchers, Border Patrol officers, vigilantes and even migrants themselves believe that Donald Trump’s second presidency is bringing a crackdown. And most of the people we met in southern Arizona say they’re excited to see it.\nTrump’s border wall had extended five miles along the edge of the land the Chiltons lease from the federal government when President Joe Biden took his oath of office. Within hours of the inauguration, Jim Chilton said, work on the barrier had stopped completely, leaving a half-mile of open border along the property line. Sue Chilton calls that “the door.”\n“That’s what it has become,” she said. “Obviously if you leave your door standing open in your house, where do people come in? The door!”\nShe said the end of the wall soon became the route for cartels bringing in groups of people. Those in civilian clothes headed for officers, asking for help from the men and women who were tasked to shuttle them to processing centers. Those migrants may have had a myriad number of reasons for wanting to get to the United States. But for the cartels, the Chiltons believe, they were mainly a decoy to take the time and the attention of the agents while the drug carriers in camo and carpet slippers did their best to go undetected.\nThe couple said Border Patrol agents told them that an average of 100 to 140 people crossed their ranch every day in April this year. Two months later, Biden put caps on the numbers who could claim asylum each day and the numbers fell to about 25 a day, the Chiltons said. But that’s still too many for them and they say the executive action came too late.\n“Currently we have tremendous numbers of really bad people coming across my ranch. It’s dangerous, they often have weapons. You really need to secure the border at the border,” said Jim, a fifth-generation rancher who keeps a rifle at his front door and drives with a pistol in his truck for self-defense. He and his wife supply food and water to anyone who asks and recognize the plight of some asylum seekers. But traffickers loaded with drugs crossing their land with near impunity makes them angry.\n“The idea that people coming through here, through my ranch, are coming in to poison our people is very, very objectionable to me,” Jim said.\nHe welcomes Trump’s strong words on closing the border to illegal crossings, including sending active-duty troops.\n“You need to prevent the drugs coming through, and if it takes the military to do it, we need to do it.”\nThe Chiltons’ support for Trump is no surprise — they had a prime speaking spot at the Republican National Convention this summer, between Tom Homan, now named as Trump’s border czar, and Texas Gov. Greg Abbott.\nAnd while they want the border wall finished, they still support legal immigration.\n“I believe that immigrants are really an important part of the United States and they have been historically,” said Jim. “Even Elon Musk, he’s an immigrant. We currently admit about a million people a year, legally — why not two million? But everybody coming in this country should come in legally.”\nHugo is himself an immigrant, but now spends some of his time off in southern Arizona trying to stop more people coming in.\nA native Uruguayan and naturalized American living in Greenwich, Connecticut, he did not want to give his last name for fear it would hurt his business. He said it was easier for him, arriving first as an exchange student back in the 1980s and then being sponsored by an employer, but said there were still opportunities to start a life in the US.\n“I don’t think anybody’s said we should have zero immigration, that’s what makes the country work and what makes the country great,” he said.\nHe feels his time with a vigilante group called Arizona Border Recon is his opportunity to give back to the country that welcomed him.\nTim Foley, the leader of the volunteers, said they were waiting to intercept 20 or so gotaways they had spotted heading north into the US. If they meet them, he said, he and his men would tell them to go back, and he expected them to do it.\n“When you’re standing there with AR-15s and my guys are pretty much all combat veterans so they know how to handle themselves, they don’t get jumpy, they just stand there and say ‘Vámonos’ and it works,” he said.\nFoley thought he would still be needed at the border even if Trump did order the military to intervene.\n“The only thing he could deploy is National Guard, and I’ve been here through three National Guard deployments,” he said, adding “Never did” when asked if troops could secure the border.\n“It takes a certain mindset” to deal with the weather and the terrain and stay on task, he said.\nOne Border Patrol agent, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told CNN he and his colleagues were “very happy” for things to change with the new Trump administration.\n“Not going to be a federal babysitter anymore,” he wrote in a text message. “Agents want to be in the field doing their job. We have a lot of territory to take back from the cartels and the scouts they employ. It’s going to take a few months to figure out the routes they’re using and scout locations … The checkpoints will be busy until (the cartels) understand that (the checkpoints) will be operating 24/7.”\nCochise County Sheriff Mark Dannels will be happy for the help. “The border is in the worst shape, the ugliest I’ve ever seen,” said Dannels, who has been in law enforcement for 40 years, the last 12 as the elected sheriff of the border county east of Nogales.\nHe blames the federal government under Biden for letting it happen, for making his county so dangerous that he must focus his deputies on catching those coming in to pick up the gotaways rather than the usual public safety responsibilities of investigating burglaries, drunk or drugged driving, and domestic violence.\n“We’ve had to reprioritize because the biggest risk this county is facing and has faced is this border. When you have — I hate to say it — repetitive criminals that have a lot of criminal histories  … coming here to commit crime, their crimes don’t stop at the border, they don’t stop at the county line, they bring stolen vehicles, guns, warrants, you name it.”\nDannels said there are areas where gotaways hide in bushes, waiting for a car to arrive, blow their horn as a signal, and pick them up. As local law enforcement, his deputies can stop suspicious vehicles and question the drivers, though Border Patrol must be called to handle any undocumented migrants.\nRelated article\nThey live near San Diego. Migrants pass through their backyards almost nightly\nDeputies often chase cars packed with people who have crossed the border illegally, but Dannels said the taxiing part of the operation is almost always done by Americans. Out of thousands of people booked by his department on border-related crime in the last 35 months, more than 90% were US citizens, he said, including teenagers too young to even get a learner’s permit.\nThe sheriff said his main hope was that the new Trump administration will at least engage on border policy in a way he thinks the Biden team did not.\n“This border is a federal government problem, not a local sheriffs’ (problem.) But once they take two or three steps into my county, it becomes my problem.”\nA few dozen miles east from the Chilton ranch, where cattle grazed while Foley and his team waited for gotaways, and a few dozen miles west from Sheriff Dannels’ patrols in Cochise County, the border wall stands tall along West International Street on the outskirts of Nogales.\nIt’s a place where families come to see and talk to each other through the fence, provided no law enforcement action is being taken.\nBut it’s also still a place where we saw just this week two people brazenly shimmying up the wall from the Mexican side, only stopping and taking off when they saw we were recording.\nWe saw a similar event on a previous visit, though then the border crossers paid us no heed and continued climbing over the wall and into the US before running off.\nIf the extra caution is one sign of things changing as Trump prepares to retake office, migrants who have established themselves in the United States are wondering what else the future will bring.\nEarlier in the week, a woman sat in a camp chair on the US side of the border, chatting to her parents and sister through the fence. She said she had been able to make a life for herself as an undocumented worker and hoped that would continue despite changes in the White House.\nHer mother, on the Mexican side, thought it could be harder to get a visa to visit her daughter. It’s been 13 years since they were able to hug.\nRelated article\nThe ‘walking route’: How an underground industry is helping migrants flee China for the US\nA man called Rafael came to the fence to celebrate his 34th birthday with his parents, brother and young son.\nHe said he spends his days working construction before going straight home to stay out of sight and any potential trouble. “I stay in my house, go to work, and try to do the best and that’s it.”\nRafael said he has a respect for Trump, despite the new threats to his own livelihood. He believed his construction site would probably close if all undocumented workers were deported, as everyone on his crew had arrived illegally.\nBut all he really wanted to do was celebrate his birthday, as close as he could get to his family. He ate cake on one side of the barrier, his relatives did the same on the other side. And after clearing up the trash, Rafael kissed his son’s finger — the only part of him that could fit through the fence.\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story misidentified an aid group camp in a photo. It has also been updated to correct the length of Sheriff Dannels’ career to 40 years in law enforcement.\n© 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

No surprises,” the transition official told CNN. “We know what works.”\nRelated article\nWhat could get more expensive if Trump launches a new trade war with Mexico and Canada\nTrump’s posts Monday on Truth Social appeared to be the opening act in a long-promised trade war with China and North American countries – as well as the latest illustration of how the president-elect plans to force other countries to help the United States stem the flow of migrants and drugs into ports and across borders, as he often vowed on the campaign trail.\nIt comes despite warnings that tariff hikes, if they come to fruition, could increase inflation. A Goldman Sachs analysis on Tuesday projected that Trump’s proposed hikes would increase the core personal consumption expenditures index — a key inflation gauge that excludes food and energy costs — by 0.9%. And Matt Priest, the president of the leading footwear industry trade group Footwear Distributors & Retailers of America, warned that Trump’s proposed tariffs would “directly increase costs for retailers and consumers, leading to higher prices on everyday essentials like shoes.”\nBut it’s a strategy that stems from a belief that similar threats worked in Trump’s first term in the Oval Office, the transition official said. During those four years, Trump took a hardline — and at times, scattershot — approach toward Latin America, which was largely the source of migration to the United States. That approach included levying consequences, like sanctions, and threatening and imposing tariffs.\nThe Goldman Sachs analysis also described Trump’s tariff announcement as “more reminiscent of the first Trump administration, when such tariffs were announced as a negotiating tactic.” Trump ultimately declined to impose some of his proposed tariffs.\nIn 2019, tariff threats ultimately resulted in Mexico giving in to the expansion of one of the Trump administration’s key immigration policies, known as “remain in Mexico,” according to two sources familiar with the matter. The unprecedented policy required migrants to stay in Mexico for the duration of their immigration proceedings in the United States.\nAt that time, Trump’s 25% tariff threat on Mexico was short-lived and resulted in a deal within a matter of weeks, spurred by a delegation of Mexican officials that traveled to Washington for urgent talks. Trump’s then-senior adviser Stephen Miller and top aides to then-Vice President Mike Pence led the negotiations on behalf of the United States.\nRelated article\n3 charts that help explain how Trump’s tariffs would work\nIf the talks had dragged out, prominent business lobbies had prepared to sue the Trump administration, alleging that the tariffs were not an adequate response to a non-trade issue.\nCNN previously reported that Trump’s team is gaming out a similarly aggressive strategy toward Latin America that will be a crucial element to plans to deport migrants and stem migration.\nThe president-elect is moving forward with that approach despite the leaders of neighboring countries responding that it won’t achieve Trump’s stated goals, and would trigger a mutually destructive trade war.\nMexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said at a news conference Tuesday that “neither threats nor tariffs will solve the issue of migration or drug consumption.”\n“Imposing one tariff would mean another comes in response, continuing like this until we put shared companies at risk,” she said.\n“For example, some of the largest exporters from Mexico to the United States are General Motors, Stellantis and Ford Motor Company, which arrived in Mexico 80 years ago,” Sheinbaum said. “Why impose a tax that puts them at risk? It’s unacceptable and would cause inflation and job losses in Mexico and the United States.”\nThe timing of Trump’s social media posts might have been a surprise, but their content was not.\nOn the campaign trail, he frequently pledged to use tariffs as a negotiating tool to bend China and North American countries’ policies to his will.\nHis advisers have acknowledged privately that tariffs could be more urgently slapped on Canada and Mexico, as Trump seeks to fulfill his campaign pledge to renegotiate his own free trade agreement.\nIn July, Canada implemented a 3% tax on the profits of large foreign technology companies operating in the country — a move that both President Joe Biden’s outgoing administration and the incoming Trump team view as discriminatory and in violation of a 2018 trade deal between the United States, Canada and Mexico.\nDuring Trump’s first term, the three countries spent more than a year hammering out that deal — the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement — to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, which went into force in 1994.\nThe new deal requires all three countries to renew it by July 1, 2026, to keep it in force — and Trump’s team is expected to call for renegotiating parts of the deal. Advisers see the new tariff threat as a way to build leverage for Trump going into those talks.\nTrump telegraphed that approach in an October speech at the Detroit Economic Club, where he said that upon taking office, he would “formally notify Mexico and Canada of my intention to invoke the six-year renegotiation provision of the USMCA that I put in.”\nTrump is said to want to open trade negotiations with Canada as quickly as possible after taking office.\nHoward Lutnick — the co-chair of Trump’s transition effort and his pick for Commerce secretary — said in a CNBC interview before the election that “of course” tariffs are a “bargaining chip,” and would help remove barriers to American-made goods in other countries.\n“This is just negotiating,” he said. But Lutnick added that Trump wouldn’t seek to slap price-raising tariffs on goods that aren’t made in the United States.\n“Do we make a lot of money on tariffs? Or we bring productivity here and we drive up our workers here?” Lutnick said. “So it’s a win-win scenario.”\nCNN’s Matt Egan and David Goldman contributed to this report.\n© 2024 Cable News Network.

    "content": "Los Angeles, the second largest US city, is setting itself up for a standoff with President-elect Donald Trump over immigration.\nOn Tuesday, its city council passed a \"sanctuary city\" ordinance to bar using local resources to help federal immigration authorities.\nLA's public school system also reaffirmed itself as a \"sanctuary\" for undocumented immigrants and LGBTQ students in a series of emergency resolutions.\nTrump, who will be sworn in in two months, has promised mass deportations once he returns to the White House. His chosen \"border czar\", Tom Homan, has urged sanctuary cities to \"get the hell out of the way\" of federal immigration crackdowns.\nThe term \"sanctuary city\" has been popular in the US for more than a decade to describe places that limit their assistance to federal immigration authorities. Since it is not a legal term, cities have taken a variety of approaches to becoming \"sanctuaries\", such as setting policies in laws or simply changing local policing practices.\nAimed at making a 2019 executive order into city law, the city council's sanctuary city ordinance prohibits using city resources for immigration enforcement, including cooperating with federal immigration agents, NBC News Los Angeles reports.\nThe ordinance will \"prevent federal immigration enforcement from being able to access city facilities or to use city resources in the pursuit of immigration enforcement\", council member Nithya Raman told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, ahead of the vote.\nIt will also prohibit some data sharing between immigration authorities and city officials and agencies.\nThe ordinance will go into effect once it has been signed by Mayor Karen Bass.\nOfficials in a number of other cities, including Boston and New York City, have similarly promised that local resources would not be allocated to helping federal immigration enforcement issues.\nSince Trump was elected the first time, dozens of school districts have declared themselves \"sanctuaries\" or \"safe havens\" to reassure students they will not be deported.\nThe Los Angeles school district - roughly 140 miles (225km) from the country's southern border with Mexico - also voted on a series of emergency resolutions explicitly aimed at combatting what the board's president, Jackie Goldberg, has described as an anti-immigrant and LGBTQ sentiment from the incoming president.\nAs well as restating a sanctuary policy for students and families within the school district, the resolution also calls for training for teachers and staff about how they should communicate with immigration authorities.\n\"We're not going to be running in fear,\" she said in quotes cited by the LA Times ahead of the resolution's passing. \"We're going to fight you, every inch of the way.\"\nThe move is likely to put the city on a collision course with the incoming Trump administration, which has vowed it will begin a large-scale mass deportation effort from the very beginning of the administration.\nTrump's chosen \"border czar\", former acting Immigrations and Customs Enforcement director Tom Homan, has repeatedly said that \"sanctuary\" city designations would not prevent the administration from carrying out its immigration policy goals.\nIn an 11 November interview with Fox, Homan said \"nothing will stop us from deporting migrant criminals.\"\n\"We're going to do the job with you, or without you,\" he said.\nThe former House speaker suffered an unspecified injury while on an official trip to Luxembourg, her office says.\nThe Grammy and Emmy winner sued the British TV producer a year ago. He described her claims as \"an appalling smear\".\nThe US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear.\nThe case - the first of its kind - will test what happens when state abortion laws are at odds.\nSome have long called for the practice of changing the clock twice a year to end.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

But that has not allayed concerns in higher education.\n\"Students are incredibly overwhelmed and stressed out right now as a result of the uncertainty around immigration,\" Prof East told the BBC.\n\"A lot of students have concerns about their visas and whether they'll be allowed to continue their education.\"\nIn November, the University of Massachusetts issued a travel advisory to its international students and faculty, encouraging them to \"strongly consider\" returning to campus from winter break before Trump takes office on 20 January.\n\"Based on previous experience with travel bans that were enacted in the first Trump Administration in 2016, the Office of Global Affairs is making this advisory out of an abundance of caution,\" the college said.\nTrump signed an executive order during his first week in the White House in 2017 banning nationals of several predominantly Muslim nations, as well as North Korea and Venezuela, from visiting the US. During his first presidency he also proposed some limitations on student visas.\nThe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Wesleyan University have also issued travel advisories, urging students and staff to return to the US before inauguration day.\nAt Yale University, the Office of International Students and Scholars hosted a webinar this month fielding concerns from students about potential immigration policy shifts, the student newspaper reported.\nThis includes foreign-born students who are protected by the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) policy.\nTrump has attempted to end the Obama-era programme, which shielded over half a million migrants who came to the US as children from deportation.\nProf East said students from Asia, particularly China, are feeling \"uncertainty\" about US-China relations under Trump.\nAoi Maeda, an international student from Japan studying at Earlham College in Indiana, is among those with concerns about her academic future.\n\"I am planning to graduate in May 2026, but now that the administration is going to be a little bit more dangerous, I'm less hopeful about things going well,\" she said.\n\"[Trump] claims that he is only interested in keeping illegal immigrants out of the country, but he also kind of tries to move the goal post a lot of times,\" Maeda continued.\n\"I feel like us international students with a visa might get affected, and it'll become easier to deport us.\"\nThe former House speaker suffered an unspecified injury while on an official trip to Luxembourg, her office says.\nThe Grammy and Emmy winner sued the British TV producer a year ago. He described her claims as \"an appalling smear\".\nThe US government says the flying objects pose no threat to national security, but their origin and intentions remain unclear.\nThe case - the first of its kind - will test what happens when state abortion laws are at odds.\nNone of first responders were injured, but the truck driver was taken to the hospital for minor injuries.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "The three Gardai - Irish police officers - walk down the rows of passengers on the bus, a few kilometres south of the border with Northern Ireland.\nObserving this is the head of the Garda National Immigration Bureau, Det Ch Supt Aidan Minnock.\n“If they don't have status to be in Ireland, we bring them to Dublin,” he explains. “They're removed on a ferry back to the UK on the same day.”\nAsylum applications in Ireland have risen by nearly 300% so far this year compared to the same period five years ago. A spike in arrivals from the UK has been driven by various factors, among these the UK’s tougher stance post-Brexit, including the fear of deportations to Rwanda, as well as Ireland’s relatively healthy economy.\nMost asylum seekers coming from the UK to the Republic of Ireland enter the country from Northern Ireland, as - unlike the airport or ferry routes - there is no passport control. The Garda checks along the 500km-long (310 miles) border are the only means of stopping illegal entry.\nDet Ch Supt Minnock told the BBC that 200 people had been returned to the UK this year as a result of these checkpoints, thought to be only a small fraction of those crossing the porous border illegally.\nMore than 2,000 people who arrived in Ireland illegally have been issued deportation orders so far this year, a 156% increase on the same period in 2023. However, only 129 of those people (just over 6%) are confirmed to have since left the state. The government has said it will begin chartered deportation flights in the coming months, and free up more immigration Gardai from desk work.\nOnboard the coach near the border, the Gardai question a young man about where he lives. He is Algerian - a student, he says. The police are suspicious and he is taken to the detention vehicle while his identity is checked.\nA veteran of war crimes investigations in post-war Bosnia - as part of an EU police team - Det Ch Supt Minnock knows well the violence and poverty that drives migration.\n“This is growing at such a scale because of the conflict and instability right across the world,” he says.\nPublic concern over immigration is closely linked to Ireland’s chronic housing problem. The Republic now has the worst record in the EU for housing young people.\nThe CEO of the Irish Refugee Council, Nick Henderson, says the crisis is a “perfect storm”, created in part by the failure to build enough housing stock over decades, and a government unprepared for the upsurge in asylum seekers - known in Ireland as International Protection Applicants (IPAs) - needing help with accommodation.\n“[The government] is only able to provide accommodation through private contractors. That, coupled with an increase in the number of people seeking protection in Ireland, and against the background of a housing crisis has meant, in effect, that Ireland's asylum reception system has really collapsed.”\nIn nearly three years, the number of asylum seekers accommodated by the state’s International Protection Accommodation Services (IPAS) has more than quadrupled - from 7,244 to 32,649 people. Over 100,000 Ukrainians, who were given a separate status, also sought refuge in Ireland during that time.\nTens of thousands of international protection applicants - some already with asylum status in Ireland, others waiting to be processed - have been sent to communities around the country, accommodated in hotels, former schools, apartments, even large tented camps.\nIreland’s housing shortage means that even those granted asylum are struggling to leave the temporary system as others arrive. Nearly 1,000 people are now living in tented accommodation.\nThis makeshift response has generated resentment. In the village of Dundrum, County Tipperary - population 221 - a group of locals attempted to block the arrival of asylum seekers at the gates of a former hotel in August. The proposal to house up to 277 people at Dundrum House, which hasn’t operated as a hotel since 2015, would double the local population. Locals worry that it will be a permanent fixture.\n“How can our government not engage properly with us?” asks Andrea Crowe, a local teacher and protester who has frequently spoken in public. She cites concerns over housing, health and education provision for the community.\nSince July, there has been a 24-hour protest outside the hotel. Ms Crowe, whose family once owned the Dundrum House hotel, accuses the government of failing to consult with the community - a common complaint around the country.\n“How can we not be concerned?” she says.\nThe IPAS community currently living at Dundrum House is made up of about 80 women and children. There is also a separate group of Ukrainian families, welcomed after the Russian invasion in February 2022.\nSeveral locals told us they feared that single men - who make up 35% of asylum seekers arriving in Ireland so far this year - would eventually replace the women and children, although there so far is no evidence to suggest this is planned in Dundrum.\nLocal builder, Martin Barry, cites the housing crisis as a key reason for his protest, particularly the plight of his eldest son. “My own young fella, he can't afford a place to rent,” he says.\nBut Martin Barry also speaks to deeper fears of change in some rural communities. The dance hall where he met his wife has closed. The local pub is for sale. There were hopes Dundrum House would be reopened and used by the local community.\n“It’s just the worry of what's coming down the line,” he says.\nWe meet two South African women given refuge at Dundrum House. Both were sent from their accommodation in Dublin - 180km (110 miles) away - to make way for newer arrivals into the capital, some of whom were sleeping in tents on the streets.\nThe women ask to remain anonymous. “Lerato” had been in Dublin for a year. “I had integrated with society, and made friends. My child was attending school and I was comfortable.” Her friend “Kayla” speaks of being isolated in Dundrum, a farming community with limited transport amenities.\nFar-right parties show scant support in opinion polls. Immigration worries are likely to be expressed in support for independent candidates. But online, far-right agitators stoke fear. There have been violent riots and arson attacks on sites meant to house, or rumoured to house, asylum seekers, and refugees have been attacked in their tents on Dublin’s streets.\nA common conspiracy theory is that migrants are being “planted” in Ireland as part of a plot to dominate Irish people and destroy their culture.\nWe saw two posters referring to a “plantation” at the Dundrum House protest. The now-closed online GoFundMe Page for Dundrum referred to Ireland’s “indigenous” population fighting “for our very existence” and the government “flooding communities with asylum seekers”.\nThe page - which raised more than €3,000 (£2,500) - was set up by a local businessman. He turns out to have posted antisemitic, Islamophobic and anti-vaccine conspiracist material on social media.\nWe ask Andrea Crowe, one of the prominent voices of the Dundrum protest, if she is comfortable with such a person being involved? Ms Crowe says she does not “follow social media much” and it is not up to her to manage other people’s reactions. But she says she’s “not comfortable with it”.\nOthers in County Tipperary welcome asylum seekers. Some 17 groups came together under the slogan “Tipperary Welcomes” after the Dundrum protest began.\nJohn Browne, a member of the community council, says the issue divides people. “I don’t have a problem with it because we're relatively wealthy, and the situation is pretty bad in parts of Africa and where most of these people are coming from.”\nBut he disagrees strongly with the numbers involved in small places like Dundrum. “It imbalances the community. And it's no good for the people coming in, because there's nothing here for them.”\nWe caught up with Ireland’s Minister for Integration, Roderic O’Gorman, while he was campaigning in Dublin for the General Election, due to be held on 29 November. He now canvasses votes with two police guards after being assaulted by a man protesting against immigration.\nMr O’Gorman says many areas welcome asylum seekers.\n“There are communities all over the place who are actually embracing and supporting,” he says.\nBut he accepts some failures. “I recognise in the initial parts of our response, there were times where there wasn't that level of engagement that we need,” he says.\nThere are now Community Engagement Teams responsible for liaising with residents, although the protesters we spoke to in Dundrum say they have had only one meeting with a team and are still no wiser about the long-term plans for the hotel.\nOfficial policy is hardening. Ukrainian asylum seekers who arrived amid widespread public sympathy and were given special benefits, recently saw these slashed from €232 (£190) to €38.80 (£32) per week - a cut of 83%.\nSouth Africans now need visas to enter the country. A visa loophole which allowed Jordanians - at one point the largest group of asylum seekers in Ireland - to enter from the UK has been closed.\nConcern over immigration has so far not translated into electoral support for far-right parties. Nick Henderson at the Refugee Council believes this need not be inevitable in Ireland. “Communities want to welcome people, but they need resources. They need communication.”\nThe Republic’s image as a stable and progressive democracy won’t change in this electoral cycle. But the rise in far-right populism internationally is a warning for the future – of how concern over immigration can be made a focus for other discontents and create turbulent politics.\nThe girl from Sierra Leone said all the 44 migrants on board had died in the storms and high waves.\nIbrahima Bah was sentenced to nine and a half years' detention in February over four deaths.\nBelgian police are cracking down on smugglers before boats and migrants reach the French coast.\nThe Joint Action Plan sees Germany commit to making it easier to prosecute those facilitating people-smuggling to the UK.\nThe strategy is designed to map out the approach the two forces will undertake from 2025-2027.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch has said her party got it \"wrong\" on immigration, leading to a strain on public services and making integration harder.\nBadenoch outlined the core principles of Conservative new immigration policy - including re-committing her party to a \"strict numerical cap\" on migration.\nThe Conservatives spent 14 years in government pledging to reduce the number of people coming to the UK but net migration - the difference between those entering and leaving - hit a record of 745,000 in 2022 before dropping last year to 685,000.\nLabour said it welcomed the Conservatives \"finally accepting that immigration spiralled out of control on their watch\".\nAt a hastily called press conference ahead of Thursday’s new migration figures, Badenoch said \"on behalf of the Conservative Party it is right that I, as the new leader, accept responsibility and say truthfully we got it wrong\".\nShe did not set out what the cap on immigration numbers would be if her party wins the next election.\nBut she pledged a full review of \"every policy, treaty and part of our legal framework\" including the role of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR) and the Human Rights Act.\nThe review will also examine migrants' access to benefits. Migrants on visas and asylum seekers in the UK cannot claim welfare benefits or social housing but can apply for access to public funds in certain circumstances.\nUnder Badenoch, the Conservatives will advocate for tightening access to British Passports and \"zero tolerance\" of foreign criminals staying in the UK, she said.\nChallenged on why a numerical cap would work under her leadership when past attempts have not, she said past leaders \"thought stating a number was enough\" and \"hoped things would work out\".\nWhen fully set out, her cap would \"explain how you get to those numbers\".\nShe also said that the Conservatives still believed that a \"deterrent\" was necessary but did not commit to a revival of the Rwanda scheme scrapped by Labour.\nSpeaking ahead of publication of the latest net migration figures, Badenoch claimed that any fall in numbers would be due to actions taken by the last Conservative government.\nCommenting on Badenoch's speech, Home Office minister Angela Eagle said the new Conservative leader \"offers no new ideas or alternative to her party’s failed policies of the past\".\n“The Conservatives wasted hundreds of millions of pounds in taxpayers’ cash on the Rwanda gimmick, and it’s clear they would do it all over again,\" she said.\nReform UK Leader Nigel Farage said the Conservatives \"broke their promises on immigration after the 2010, 2015, 2017 and 2019 manifestos\".\n“Why on earth would I or anyone else believe them now,\" he added.\nIn her speech, Badenoch said the UK \"cannot sustain the numbers we have seen\" on immigration.\n\"We are reducing the quality of life for people already here because immigration is at a pace too fast to maintain public services, and at a rate where it is next to impossible to integrate those from radically different cultures,\" she said.\n\"The ties that bind us start to fray.\n\"It doesn't matter whether you are massively for immigration or massively against it, without a shared national identity, our country will suffer.\"\nThis is not the first time Badenoch has criticised her party's record on immigration.\nAt her speech at this year's Conservative Party Conference, she blamed the Treasury for pushing immigration up claiming it \"was good for the economy\".\n\"But we knew it was not good for our country,\" she told party members.\nWhen the government \"does not grasp the realities\" of immigration \" we know it's time to make a change\", she said.\nThe PM and his colleagues agree the illegal people smuggling trade in Britain must end - but there's huge disagreement over what should be done.\nKemi Badenoch claims Labour is punishing non-metropolitan areas with high housing targets.\nThe Conservative leader says everyone has their own tastes after expressing her dislike of sandwiches.\nThe Joint Action Plan sees Germany commit to making it easier to prosecute those facilitating people-smuggling to the UK.\nShe told centre-right politicians in Washington she loved the title, even though it was meant to be an insult.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "Of all of this new government’s big promises, getting economic growth up and immigration down are the two biggies – and their early months in office show just how hard achieving either, let alone both, will be.\nEconomic growth has been stuttery and half-hearted for ages.\nAnd immigration, both legal and illegal, via small boat crossings, has ballooned in recent years.\nNow, Sir Keir Starmer and Home Secretary Yvette Cooper have reached a milestone with a big number attached.\nOver the weekend, the number of people who have arrived on small boats since the general election in July exceeded 20,000.\nPrivately, ministers acknowledge that successfully tackling irregular, illegal migration is absolutely key to how competent or otherwise the government is perceived to be; however fair or otherwise that might be, given the scale of the challenge.\nThose pictures of dinghies bobbing around in the Channel are hugely powerful: they represent a geopolitical, diplomatic, humanitarian, economic and political issue all rolled into one.\nFor some it can be described more bluntly: people breaking into the country, with those with the job of stopping it failing.\nAs Nick Robinson sets out here after a week of reporting on this for the Today Programme on Radio 4, the huge amount of people desperate to reach the UK and other countries like it is not likely to shrink significantly.\nAnd so the political argument revolves around what can be done to put people off trying.\nOne thing that does put people off, but politicians have no control over, is the weather.\nThe boats that are used are incredibly flimsy for a sea journey. I have seen and touched them, when visiting Border Force in Dover. They are made of the same stuff as a bouncy castle.\nSo it is not surprising that when the weather isn’t great, and in particular when there are plenty of waves, fewer crossings are attempted.\nThe Home Office classifies each day according to the weather, with those judged to have the most benign conditions on the water called 'red days'.\nBetween mid October and mid November this year, there was the highest concentration of so-called red days in any month since the big uptick in small boat crossings in 2021.\nOf the 31 days between those dates, 26 fell into that category and 6,288 people crossed the  Channel.\nIn the same period last year there were three red days and 768 arrivals.\nBut expect to see the Conservatives brand this as a ‘dog ate my homework excuse’ or words to that effect.\nThey will argue that the abandonment of the previous government’s plan to send some migrants to Rwanda has meant the removal of a crucial deterrent to potential crossings.\nWhen Yvette Cooper and the shadow home secretary Chris Philp debate this in the Commons on Monday afternoon, we can expect the Rwanda policy to be a big part of the conversation.\nCooper will attempt to, at least, partially itemise where the £700m spent on the idea went.\nShe will claim that the cost of the four people who volunteered to go to Rwanda was the equivalent of the total cost of the state education of a single child in England.\nThe home secretary will instead claim that focused on what is described as the ‘upstream problem’ – where smuggling gangs initially recruit people to make the long journeys to the West – is key.\nLast week she was in the Kurdistan region of Iraq to sign a deal to try to tackle the gangs and ensure the speedy return of failed Iraqi asylum seekers.\nPhilp is expected to argue this deal is thin and the financial commitment is comparable with resurfacing a local road rather than the basis for a game-changing solution.\nMany of the arguments will be familiar as will the grapple for plausible, workable solutions - which were out of the grasp of the last government and, while it is early days, appear out of the grasp of the new one too.\nThe ex-Labour leader says there was \"no clear plan\" when MPs were asked to vote for military action against Syria in 2013.\nCouncillor Will Markham defects to the Tories, accusing Labour of “acting in their own interests”.\nA government source tells the BBC the increasing size of the civil service cannot continue.\nThe chancellor says \"efficiency savings\" will ensure enough funding for key public services.\nLabour has ruled out rejoining the EU but may be open to alignment on areas such as farm and food exports.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

    "content": "A Nazi sympathiser has been found by a court to have prepared a terrorism attack on an immigration law firm after choosing them as a target after reading a Daily Mail article.\nCavan Medlock carried a Nazi flag and a knife into a London solicitors' offices in 2020 and then launched an attack on staff.\nThe attack caused so much alarm that senior lawyers lobbied the then home secretary, Dame Priti Patel, to reconsider some of the language she and others were using, claiming that it was adding to tensions.\nLeaders in the profession say the incident has led to continuing concern as extreme right-wing groups single out lawyers for abuse and threats.\nDuring his police interview, Medlock said he had chosen the firm and its immigration chief as targets after they had been named in a Daily Mail article three days earlier.\nThe finding at Kingston Crown Court on Tuesday was not a criminal conviction - but a conclusion by a jury of factually what happened.\nA trial of the facts occurs in rare circumstances when a defendant is not well enough to either admit or deny a charge, but a case needs to be concluded.\nAn attempt to put Medlock on trial in March was aborted after he suffered an episode of very serious mental ill health.\nThe jury found he had committed the acts of preparing for an act of terrorism and making threats to kill when he stormed into the offices of law firm Duncan Lewis.\nA senior judge will decide on Thursday how best to manage Medlock's detention for public protection because he is too mentally unwell to be in a prison.\nThat incident happened on 7 September 2020 when the then 27-year-old Medlock walked into the firm, which has a specialist immigration law team who handle some of the most complex cases in the country.\nMedlock repeatedly asked to see the firm's head of immigration law - but after about 15 minutes of waiting, he pulled out a six-inch knife and lunged at a receptionist.\nThe member of staff succeeded in disarming Medlock, who was ultimately overwhelmed and subdued by other staff who rushed to the scene.\nMedlock then declared that he had come to kill the senior lawyer he had been asking for and used racially offensive language against other members of staff.\nWhen one of them identified herself as Jewish, Medlock expressed support for Hitler and the Holocaust.\nPolice later found a Swastika flag in his bag - and his interview confirmed an ideological motive that fitted the legal definition of terrorism.\nAt the time Medlock was not diagnosed with any mental ill health condition and he was assessed by a nurse as fit to speak to officers.\nIn his police interview, he told detectives that he had wanted to stop the firm helping immigrants by taking its immigration chief captive.\nHe then planned to put the Nazi flag, and another relating to the US's slave era states, in the firm's window as a \"rallying cry to other nationalists\".\n\"When politics fails and the people have no alternative, I think violence is the only natural progression of that thinking to get change,\" he told officers, warning that there was a \"white genocide\" under way.\n\"Boris Johnson, he's not going to do anything about mass immigration,\" he said.\n\"How many times have the Conservatives promised to bring the immigration [level] to 100,000 a year, and failed?\"\nTimothy Cray KC, prosecuting, told Kingston Crown Court: \"He was admitting carrying out acts of preparation for terrorism. His brand of terrorism was clear.\n\"By his own admission, at the time of the attacks, he identified as a Nazi. We say that plan was designed to intimidate a section of the public.\n\"Can you imagine the [media] coverage? A solicitor held hostage, or perhaps worse, and the Nazi flag flying in London.\n\"Perhaps we can console ourselves with the fact that he would not have had many takers.\"\nDuring his police interview, Medlock said he had chosen the firm and its immigration chief as targets after they had been named in a Daily Mail article three days earlier.\n\"I first saw his name on [The] Daily Mail, a couple of days ago,\" said Medlock.\n\"And then when I Googled his name and I found out he has his office right here... I was like, you know, these people, they can't just continue to flood Europe with people nobody wants here and get away with it.\"\nMedlock's phone history confirmed he had read the article which referred to \"UK lawyers who coach asylum seekers\" to avoid deportation.\nA spokesman for the Mail said: \"The Mail gives no support to terrorists, whatever their politics.\n\"The article referenced in this case was a legitimate piece of investigative journalism in the public interest, and the law firm involved was quoted so their view would be represented.\n\"We welcome the fact that the mentally-unwell person who planned this terrorist incident is facing justice.\"\nThat article came after sources in Boris Johnson's government had been briefing some journalists for weeks that \"activist lawyers\" had been holding up some deportations, the court heard.\nThe phrase was used publicly a week before the attack in a video posted on the Home Office's account on Twitter, now known as X.\nThe department's top civil servant then banned it from the government's PR releases.\nBut Dame Priti Patel, then home secretary, used the phrase in her own tweet the day before the Mail's article - but she did not publicly mention Duncan Lewis or any other firm.\nThe Bar Council, the professional body for barristers in England and Wales, condemned the language and at the time called on her and Boris Johnson to \"stop deliberately inflammatory language towards a profession simply doing its job\".\nMr Johnson had made separate comments deriding human rights lawyers in his October 2020 party conference speech, but did not refer to Duncan Lewis or immigration cases.\nSam Townend KC, the council's current president, said that it had continued to warn of anti-lawyer rhetoric and it hoped a page had now been turned - but the profession's concerns remain exceptionally high.\nRichard Atkinson, the president of the Law Society, which represents solicitors, said: \"The attack on Duncan Lewis solicitors was the first example of a worrying new trend.\n\"This eventually led to threatened attacks on 39 law firms and advice agencies during this summer's riots.\n\"Many lawyers have faced deaths threats and have had to seek police protection. Until recently, this was unheard of in our country.\n\"This trend did not emerge from nowhere. It was closely associated with a degraded debate led by senior parliamentarians and sections of the media, largely focused on the immigration and asylum system.\n\"Words have consequences, particularly when they come from people in positions of seniority and power. They can legitimise hate, encourage division, and have serious repercussions.\"\nDame Priti Patel has been contacted for comment.\nCopyright 2024 BBC.

He views tariffs as a negotiating tool with other nations.\nIn a Fox News op-ed, Bessent argued that tariffs are \"a useful tool for achieving the president's foreign policy objectives. Whether it is getting allies to spend more on their own defense, opening foreign markets to US exports, securing cooperation on ending illegal immigration and interdicting fentanyl trafficking, or deterring military aggression, tariffs can play a central role.\"\nWhen Trump imposed higher tariffs during his first term in office, other countries, including Canada, responded with retaliatory tariffs of their own.\nHowever, Trump brokered the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which came into law in 2020.\nIt meant goods moving between the United States, Canada and Mexico crossed borders largely duty-free.\nHis reference to the fentanyl crisis and illegal immigration suggests he is leveraging national security issues to justify breaking the deal, a move permitted under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules.\nMexico's Finance Ministry, however, said, \"Mexico is the United States' top trade partner, and the USMCA provides a framework of certainty for national and international investors.\"\nA joint statement from Canada's Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland and Public Safety Minister Dominic Leblanc said they would discuss the border and vast economic ties with the incoming US administration.\n\"Canada places the highest priority on border security and the integrity of our shared border. Our relationship today is balanced and mutually beneficial, particularly for American workers,\" the statement read.\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck said Trump's tariffs announcement should be taken seriously, adding that Europe and Germany needed to seek talks to avert a potential trade war.\nAt an industry event in Berlin, Habeck emphasized that talks were needed to ensure that all sides did not lose out.\n\"The first thing is to seek dialogue,\" he said.\nMeanwhile, the Chinese Embassy in Washington warned neither the US nor China would win a trade war.\nlo/jsi (AP, AFP, Reuters, dpa)"

Powell last month said he would refuse to step down if Trump tried to remove him before the end of his current term.\nWhen asked about reproductive rights and birth control, Trump said he would not limit access to abortion pills.\nAnother \"day-one\" promise Trump made on Sunday was that he would look at issuing pardons \"very quickly\" for jailed January 6 defendants imprisoned for their role in the 2021 insurrection at the US Capitol.\nHundreds of Trump-supporting rioters remain behind bars and dozens have been convicted and sentenced to prison. Their cause has been championed by many on the far-right, both in politics and in the media. Trump, who headlined events that day, has come under pressure to set them free.\nAlthough he won't take the oath of office until January 20, Trump is already actively influencing world affairs. On Saturday, he met with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and French President Emmanuel Macron before attending the re-opening of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris.\nOn Sunday, he told the world \"Ukraine wants to make a deal\" to end the war in Ukraine, and called on Russian President Vladimir Putin to end the fighting.\nWhen asked in the interview — which was taped Friday, before Trump and Zelenskyy met — whether he would reduce US aid to Ukraine, Trump said, \"Possibly, yeah, probably, sure.\"\nTrump also spoke about the NATO military alliance, of which he has been highly critical in the past. Trump has repeatedly hinted at withdrawing the US from the powerful 32-member military alliance.\nAsked if the US would remain in the alliance on his watch, Trump said, \"If they're paying their bills, and if I think they're treating us fairly, the answer is absolutely I'd stay with NATO.\" If allies, however, weren't paying their fair share, or treating the US fairly in Trump's eyes, then he said, he would \"absolutely\" consider leaving.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\njs/rmt (AFP, Reuters)"

Follow DW for more.\nRussia unleashed its second big attack on Ukraine's energy infrastructure this month on Thursday, triggering deep power cuts across the country.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said the airstrikes on Ukraine were Moscow's \"response\" to Kyiv's attacks with US-made ATACMS missiles.\nPutin also threatened to use Russia's new intermediate-range \"Oreshnik\" missile at the Ukrainian capital Kyiv.\nMeanwhile, Germany's spy chief said that Russia is banking on the collapse of NATO.\nThis blog on the developments in Russia's war in Ukraine on Thursday, November 28 is now closed.\nA medical facility in Kyiv's Dniprovskyi district caught fire following a Russian drone strike, according to Serhiy Popko, the head of the Kyiv City Military Administration.\nPopko said one person was injured after the attack.\nThe official also told Kyiv residents to stay in shelters during the ongoing air raid alert.\nUS President Joe Biden condemned the latest Russian assault on Ukrainian energy infrastructure, labeling it \"outrageous.\"\n\"This attack is outrageous and serves as yet another reminder of the urgency and importance of supporting the Ukrainian people in their defense against Russian aggression,\" Biden said in a statement put out by the White House.\nAirstrikes from Russia on Ukraine which occurred overnight Wednesday into Thursday had left over 1 million Ukrainians without electricity, Ukrainian regional officials said.\n\"Russia continues to underestimate the bravery, resilience and determination of the Ukrainian people. The United States stands with more than 50 countries in support of Ukraine and its fight for freedom,\" Biden added.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBiden's remarks come as his presidency nears its end, with President-elect Donald Trump set to be inaugurated on January 20. Trump has suggested cutting off aid to Ukraine and said he could end the war in 24 hours, without explaining how.\nIn response to Putin's threats to use Oreshnik missiles and hit \"decision-making\" centers in Kyiv, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy said the Russian leader \"has no interest in ending this war.\"\n\"Moreover, Putin wants to prevent others from ending this war,\" Zelenskyy said in his evening address. \"His current saber-rattling with 'Oreshnik' is aimed solely at disrupting the efforts of (US President-elect Donald) Trump that are sure to follow his inauguration.\"\nTrump has claimed that he could end Russia's invasion of Ukraine in a period of 24 hours and it is likely that there will be extensive negotiations to end the war after he is inaugurated on January 20.\n\"Putin wants to escalate the situation now so that President Trump fails to end the war,\" Zelenskyy said. \"Putin is the only culprit in this war and the only one who believes in war. That is why Putin's escalation now is a form of pressure aimed at eventually forcing the president of the United States to accept Russia's terms. We are aware of all the existing threats.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe European Parliament has adopted a resolution which \"condemned Russia's use of North Korean troops against the Ukrainian army and its testing of new ballistic missiles in Ukraine.\"\nThe resolution said these \"recent escalatory steps represent a new phase in the war and a new risk for Europe's security as a whole.\"\nThe resolution urged EU member states to intensify sanctions on Iran, Belarus and North Korea — three countries accused of helping Russia with military aid and support amid the invasion of Ukraine.\nThe resolution also called on China to end military aid to Russia, \"adding that a refusal to change course risks seriously affecting bilateral EU-China relations.\"\nThe resolution also said \"all EU member states and NATO should commit to supporting Ukraine militarily.\"\nIt welcomed \"US President Joe Biden's decision to allow Ukraine to use advanced rocket systems on military targets within Russian territory\" and called \"for the EU and its member states to adopt similar measures.\"\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has criticized Russian President Vladimir Putin's threats to hit decision-making centers in Kyiv with the \"Oreshnik\" missile.\n\"By those statements, Putin again demonstrates that he is the only person who wants this war to continue and to expand this war,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Heorhii Tykhyi said.\nTykhyi said Putin's remarks are disrespectful to countries such as China and Brazil which are urging restraint in the conflict.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\"We expect those countries that have urged everyone to avert the expansion of the war to react to the statements voiced by Putin today,\" Tykhyi said.\nHe said Putin's remarks are \"blackmail\" targeting Ukraine's allies and US President-elect Donald Trump, who is pushing for an end to the war in Ukraine.\n\"Putin obviously tries to influence the US administration by these statements, and he tries to basically show that this new administration is weak,\" Tykhyi said.\nGermany has offered to re-deploy Patriot air defense systems to Poland early next year to help protect Ukraine's weapons supply lines.\n\"With this we will protect a logistical hub in Poland which is of central importance for the delivery of materials to Ukraine,\" German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said.\nHis Polish counterpart, Wladyslaw Kosiniak-Kamysz, welcomed the decision.\nIn 2023, Berlin deployed three Patriot units to eastern Poland following a deadly blast in a village attributed to a stray Ukrainian air defense missile. That deployment ended in November of that year.\nPistorius said a new deployment in January would mean that \"together with our Polish friends, we are also securing NATO airspace, as we did last year.\"\nPresident Volodymyr Zelenskyy has approved a significant increase in Ukraine's military spending for 2025, allocating over $50 billion (€47 billion) to defense and security.\nThat's equivalent to about 60% of all expenditure.\nBy comparison, Russia plans to spend more than $150 billion on defense and security next year.\nUkraine's budget document also outlines the first wartime tax increases since Russia's invasion, nearly three years ago.\nFinance Minister Serhiy Marchenkko said the budget was vital to ensure smooth funding for the Ukrainian defense sector next year. It also covers payments for soldiers and weapons production.\n\"The priority of the budget remains the defense of our state,\" Prime Minister Denys Shmygal said in a post on Telegram.\nUkraine receives significant military and humanitarian aid from Western partners to supplement its military spending.\nRussian President Vladimir Putin has threatened to use Russia's new intermediate-range \"Oreshnik\" missile against the Ukrainian capital, Kyiv.\n\"We do not rule out the use of Oreshnik against the military, military-industrial facilities or decision-making centers, including in Kyiv,\" Putin said at a press conference in the Kazakh capital Astana.\nKyiv has strong air defenses. However, Putin claims that the Oreshnik, which Russia used for the first time on the Ukrainian city of Dnipro last week, cannot be intercepted. Western experts have expressed skepticism about this claim.\nRussia has not yet targeted Ukrainian government ministries, parliament, or the president's office during the war.\nPutin also said Russia would use all weapons at its disposal against Ukraine if Kyiv were to acquire nuclear arms.\nThe New York Times reported last week that unnamed Western officials suggested US President Joe Biden could provide Ukraine with nuclear weapons.\n\"If the country which we are essentially at war with now becomes a nuclear power, what do we do? In this case, we will use all, I want to emphasize this, precisely all means of destruction available to Russia. Everything: we will not allow it,\" Putin said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nThe German Foreign Office has summoned the Russian ambassador to Berlin, Sergey Nechayev, over Moscow's expulsion of two journalists from German public broadcaster ARD.\n\"The expulsion of ARD employees by Russia is unacceptable, and the justification is simply false and dishonest. We condemn this in the strongest terms,\" Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock said.\nRussian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the move was in response to the expulsion of correspondents from Russian state broadcaster Channel One on Wednesday — a claim that Berlin denies.\n\"Here in Germany, the relevant authorities have taken decisions against two employees of a Russian broadcaster in line with immigration law; these can be appealed,\" Baerbock said.\n\"Russia's President (Vladimir) Putin has again and again turned the thumbscrews on the press in his country,\" she added. \"Free reporting is not possible anymore in Russia, including for foreign journalists.\"\nRussian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday's airstrikes on Ukraine was Moscow's \"response\" to Kyiv's attacks with US-made ATACMS missiles.\n\"We carried out a comprehensive strike,\" Putin told allies during a Kazakhstan visit several hours after the attack.\nThe Russian leader has criticized Ukraine's allies for permitting Kyiv to use Western weapons against Russian targets, warning of retaliation.\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy accused Russia of a \"despicable escalation.\"\n\"In several regions, strikes with cluster munitions were recorded, and they targeted civilian infrastructure,\" he said in a post on Telegram.\n\"This is a very despicable escalation of Russian terrorist tactics,\" he added.\nOvernight Russian air strikes have left more than 1 million Ukrainians without electricity, regional officials said on Thursday.\n\"As of now, 523,000 subscribers in [the] Lviv region are without electricity,\" regional head Maksym Kozytskyi said in a post on social media.\nMeanwhile, in the northwestern Rivne region more than 280,000 households were left without power, regional head Oleksandr Koval said. Some schools in Rivne were ordered to study remotely.\nStrikes were also reported in the Volyn region, where 215,000 households have no electricity, according to the head of administration, Ivan Rudnytskyi.\nThe head of Ukraine's presidential office, Andrii Yermak, claimed that Russia had stockpiled missiles to strike Ukrainian infrastructure during the cold season.\n\"They were helped by their crazy allies, including from North Korea,\" he wrote on Telegram.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nExplosions rang through the Ukrainian cities of Odessa, Kropyvnytskyi, Kharkiv, Rivne and Lutsk on Thursday amid reports of a major Russian cruise missile attack, Ukrainian media said.\nUkraine's energy minister said that the strikes targeted critical infrastructure.\n\"Once again, the energy sector is under massive enemy attack,\" Ukrainian Energy Minister German Galushchenko said on Facebook.\n\"Attacks on energy facilities are taking place across Ukraine.\"\nThe minister added that the national power grid's operator had \"urgently introduced emergency power cuts.\"\nThe Ukrainian military reported that there were inbound missiles targeting several regions.\n\"Air raid alert has been declared all over the territory of Ukraine due to a missile threat,\" the Ukrainian air force said on Telegram.\nOther messages from the air force added that the missiles that were detected were headed for Kharkiv, Odesa and eight other regions.\n\"Kharkiv, go to the shelters!\" the air force said in a separate message on Telegram.\nThe head of Germany's foreign intelligence service BND has warned about increasing Russian hybrid attacks on Germany and the NATO defense alliance, with the underlying aim to test the alliance in hopes that it would collapse.\nBruno Kahl said BND believes that high-ranking officials in Russia's Defense Ministry seem to have doubts about whether NATO's mutual defense commitments and the United States' extended deterrence in Europe would hold in a serious situation.\n\"Currently, there is no evidence of concrete war intentions by Russia. But if such views gain ground in the government headquarters in Moscow, the risk of a military confrontation also grows in the coming years,\" he said at an event held by the German Society for Foreign Policy late on Wednesday.\nKahl said he did not believe Moscow would engage in such a confrontation to gain territory, but rather to stamp out NATO.\n\"Certainly not expansive territorial acquisition would be the focus,\" he said, but Russian President Vladimir Putin's aim is for NATO to fail as a defense alliance, the spy chief stressed.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\ndvv/zc (AFP, Reuters, AP, dpa)"

    "content": "As concern mounts that Argentina might leave the Paris Agreement, DW takes a look at what the course is doing to address climate change and the course that this may take under climate-skeptic President Javier Milei.\nLast week, Argentina's climate-skeptic president, Javier Milei, ordered his negotiators to abruptly leave the COP29 talks taking place in Baku, Azerbaijan, where countries are hashing out a deal on new financing targets for climate action.\nMilei, who has described climate change as a \"socialist lie,\" has made it clear that environmental concerns are far down his list of priorities.\nSince taking office in December last year, he has downgraded Argentina's Environment Ministry to a subsecretariat, removed a fund for forest protection and passed a law that would further boost the oil and gas sector.\nNow there are worries that the far-right leader will pull his country out of the Paris Climate Agreement, following in the footsteps of his ally, US President-elect Donald Trump.\nTrump has said he wants to walk out on the international treaty, which aims to limit global average temperature rise to well below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit), for a second time once he re-enters the White House.\nThe withdrawal of Argentina from the COP29 summit implies that the country it is out of any current negotiations, including talks on potential energy transition or adaptation funds, said Maria Victoria Emanuelli, Buenos-Aires based Latin America campaign director of environmental NGO 350.org.\nEmanuelli described the decision as \"erratic and unpredictable\" and said it could cost Argentina a considerable sum needed for climate action and ultimately harm the poorest in society.\n\"The vulnerable populations in Argentina are also the ones who suffer more the extreme climate phenomena, but Milei's policies clearly show that this is not important for his government,\" she said.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nBut Emanuelli didn't think that Argentina's withdrawal would undermine the negotiations themselves because the country is a \"small player on the international scene.\"\nGoing further and pulling out of the Paris Agreement would have such far-reaching implications for Argentina's society and economy that it \"borders on absurdity,” said Andrew Forth, head of policy and advocacy at Climate Group, an international NGO focused on climate action.\n\"Excluding itself from global discussions not only weakens Argentina's ability to influence rules of trade, climate finance and international cooperation, it also leaves the country sidelined in shaping the very rules that will determine its future resilience and prosperity and help address the escalating impacts of climate change at home,\" he said.\nArgentina is vulnerable to a wide range of climate change impacts that vary across its vast and diverse landscapes, including deserts, huge shorelines and glaciers, as well as both subtropical and subantarctic regions.\nIn recent years, the country has been hit by extreme heat, severe drought, water scarcity and destructive flooding. In the summer months of 2022-2023, the country experienced its highest temperatures in 60 years.\nTwo consecutive heat waves, which saw record-breaking temperatures in Argentina and Paraguay during that season, were made 60 times more likely due to human-induced climate change, according to a study by World Weather Attribution, a UK-based academic institution.\nAs climate change continues to heat the planet, the country is expected to suffer more frequent and intense floods, droughts and wildfires, as well as rising sea levels and accelerated melting of the country's numerous glaciers, according to the World Bank.\nUnder a 2 C global temperature rise, which the world is on track to pass, Argentina would see a 33% increase in agricultural drought frequency and 1,032% increase in heat wave duration, according to a report from the CMCC Foundation, a research center focusing on climate change and society.\nAlthough, the country has committed to net-zero emissions by 2050, Argentina's climate policies and plans to cut emissions — committed to under the Paris Agreement — have been deemed \"critically insufficient\" by scientists from Climate Action Tracker. CAT is an independent scientific project monitoring government climate measures.\nCAT highlights that in 2022, the country fast-tracked the building of a pipeline to substantially increase gas production and continues to expand oil extraction and offshore fossil fuel exploration.\nWhile Argentina's diverse geography and climate means that it has much potential for renewables, such as solar, wind and hydropower, 88% of its energy comes from fossil fuels. It currently contributes to less than 1% of global emissions.\nThe threats of Argentina leaving the Paris Agreement should be taken with a pinch of salt as they are partly a performance, said Veronica Geese, energy secretary of the Argentinian province of Santa Fe.\n\"Argentina can't leave the Paris Agreement because it's reinforced by law, so it will not happen — at least not soon,\" Geese said.\nShe added that, despite the approach of the presidency, many local governments such as hers in Sante Fe province would continue to push forward their climate goals and commitments.\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\nIf Milei pursues his aim of leaving the Paris Agreement, it would serve to further isolate the country, according to Niklas Höhne, an expert in climate policy at nonprofit think tank NewClimate Institute.\n\"Argentina will become even less attractive as a trading partner for anyone who takes climate protection seriously, especially now that various countries, above all the EU, are introducing import duties for climate-damaging products,\" said Höhne.\nOscar Soria, head of The Common Initiative, a New York-based group campaigning for financial reform to promote biodiversity, told AFP that global climate action will continue \"with or without Argentina.\"\n\"That was shown in the United States when Donald Trump took the decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement in 2017,\" said Soria.\nEdited by: Jennifer Collins"
