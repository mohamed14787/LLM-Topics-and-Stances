Policy Change for Germany
We are all aware of the state of our country – and the fact that it cannot continue like this.
The public rightly expects each federal government to ensure that the country and its people
enjoy greater prosperity by the end of its term of office. The coalition government has failed
to deliver on this. Germany has lost three years – and we face momentous challenges. Much
hangs in the balance in the years to come. The issues at stake include nothing less than our
freedom, peace, prosperity, security and social cohesion.
At the same time, we believe our country and citizens have enormous potential. We have
what it takes to put Germany back on track. All we need to do is to unleash this potential once
again.
That is why our country needs a federal government that will once again tackle the things
that really matter: safeguarding the right to live in peace and freedom, prosperity for all,
security and social cohesion. Our country needs stability and progress. Our country needs
political change!

We firmly believe that the right policies can ensure that Germany will again take a leading
role. And we promise that we will make it happen.
Here’s how we’re going to get there:
Delivering a new promise of prosperity
Germany needs political leadership that puts working people first – an agenda for the hardworking. We need comprehensive tax relief. Hard work must pay off again.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• ease the tax burden on low and middle-income earners in particular. To do this, we will
adjust the income tax rate. Our goal for social security contributions: we want to reduce the
total contributions paid to 40 per cent again.
• exempt overtime pay for those in full-time employment from tax. Those who voluntarily
work extra hours should take home more of their gross pay.
• increase the commuter allowance. Doing so will help support our service providers in rural
areas.
• modernise labour legislation: in the future, all companies will be subject to a maximum
weekly working time instead of a daily one.
• set up a digital ‘Work and Stay Agency’ for foreign professionals. It will serve as a one-stop
shop for recruitment, job placement, verification of entry requirements, visa issuance and
residence permits.

Taking the economy forward – new freedom to unlock potential
There is more to life than the economy, but without the economy, life is impossible. That is
why we are committed to growth, investment, freedom for our companies and good jobs.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• cut corporate tax rates to a maximum of 25 per cent, abolish the solidarity surcharge and
improve depreciation and loss offsetting.
• eliminate unnecessary red tape by introducing laws to simplify and cut through
bureaucracy, reduce reporting requirements and duplicate structures.
• remove restrictions: we will abolish the German Supply Chain Act.
• put an end to overfulfilment: to do this, we will reverse Germany’s overcompliance with
European law and prevent it in the future.

Ensuring affordable energy and climate protection through economic measures
We will put an end to the ideologically driven policies of the previous government. We need
political change now: working with the people, not against them – that is how energy and
climate policies work.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• lower the electricity tax and grid fees. We need to quickly and significantly reduce the cost
of electricity for everyone.
• develop grids, storage facilities and all renewables, and focus on affordability and security
of supply. Prices can only come down if we increase supply.
• keep nuclear energy on the table. That’s why we will prioritise research into fourth- and
fifth-generation nuclear technology, small modular reactors and fusion power plants. We
will review the resumption of operations at the most recently shut-down nuclear power
plants.
• abolish the previous government’s heating law. The bureaucratic meddling with people’s
heating bills must end. We will promote low-emission heating solutions based on opensource technology.
• commit to emissions trading. It is the right instrument to efficiently limit emissions and thus
protect the climate in the best possible way.

Making Germany fit for innovation, digitalization and start-ups
Research, innovation, technology and transfer (RITT) form the basis for a competitive
economy with well-paid jobs. Spin-offs and the transfer to marketable solutions must be
more successful. Back to the top with ‘Made in Germany’!
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• drive the re-industrialization of our country with digitalization, sovereign AI, and cloud
applications. Future technologies need flexibility. The state needs clear responsibilities. To
this end, we will set up a federal digital ministry.

-2-
• ensure that businesses and the state spend 3.5 per cent of the gross domestic product on
research and development by 2030.
• introduce a high-tech agenda. Germany must become a centre of excellence and innovation
for future aerospace and quantum computing technologies. We will pursue a new,
ambitious space strategy.
• encourage entrepreneurship. With a ‘start-up protection zone’, we will largely exempt new
companies from bureaucratic regulations in the start-up phase.
• change course: Data protection policy must become a serious data opportunities policy. We
must seize the opportunities for innovation and growth that open-source data offers.

For a strong and just social state
That is what employees expect from politics. And rightly so, because it is their motivation
that creates our prosperity.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• abolish social welfare (Bürgergeld) and replace it with a new type of essential income
support. The principle of ‘supporting and challenging’ must always apply.
• support the statutory minimum wage and a strong and independent minimum wage
commission. Wage determination must be a matter for the social partners for the purposes
of fairness and economic reasons.
• promote private provision through property and assets by increasing the tax-free
allowances for land transfer tax and inheritance tax, as well as for savings. We reject a
wealth tax.
• retain the existing legal regulation on retirement age. We won’t allow any pension cuts.
• introduce a new ‘active’ form of pension. Those who voluntarily continue to work beyond
the statutory retirement age will receive a monthly tax-free salary of up to EUR 2,000.
• introduce an early retirement pension. The state will support personal and private-funded
pension schemes for all 6 to 18-year-olds with EUR 10 monthly. This is how we will create a
starting capital for early private retirement provision.
• take a great deal of red tape away from pensioners and want to make their tax returns
unnecessary in most cases.

Supporting local agriculture
Farmers deserve recognition, respect, and trust. We will provide relief through better
framework conditions and planning security.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• reintroduce the full agricultural diesel rebate. By doing so, we will take the pressure off
farms.
• work hard in Brussels to ensure the agriculture budget remains well funded. At the same
time, we must drastically simplify the current agricultural policy.

-3-
• declare war on bureaucracy: Material flow balance in fertiliser law, soil law, and taxonomy.
A farmer must be able to be a farmer again.
• ensure farmers and foresters can rely on us: we will support innovative technologies and
sustainable management. There will be no compulsory set-aside of land under our
government.
• control the wolf population. Regionally differentiated hunting of wolves must be possible
so that fewer grazing animals get killed.

Enforcing law and order
We will pursue a zero-tolerance strategy, backing the police and law enforcement authorities
and giving them the necessary powers to do their jobs.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• strengthen criminal law and expedite proceedings. A crime must be punished immediately.
• increasingly rely on electronic ankle monitors. Perpetrators of violence against women
must be stopped.
• deploy more video cameras and automated facial recognition systems at hot and precarious
spots. Criminals must not be allowed to get away with crime.
• require internet providers to store IP addresses. We will consistently take action against all
forms of violence against children, including online.
• abolish the previous government’s cannabis law. This law protects dealers and exposes our
children and young people to drug use and addiction.

Stopping illegal migration
Our country needs a fundamental change in migration policy. The influx is too much and can
no longer be managed. A strict limitation of migration is urgently needed.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• control the German borders and enforce strict border rejections. We must decide again who
can come to us and who can stay.
• accelerate asylum procedures and repatriations. To this end, we will designate further
countries as safe countries of origin. We will also deport people back to Syria and
Afghanistan.
• suspend family reunification for those entitled to subsidiary protection and terminate all
voluntary admission programmes.
• provide social services for deportees following the principle established by the courts of
‘bed, bread and soap’. We don’t cut corners when it comes to payment cards.
• change European asylum law and recognise our humanitarian responsibility. Anyone
seeking asylum in Europe should be transferred to a safe third country, where their case
will be processed and, where necessary, they will receive protection.

Security and safety – fighting the enemies of our state
We will counter the increasing extremist threats with a 360-degree approach. We will fight
every form of extremism, violence, and terror with full force.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• crack down on and punish those who support terrorist organisations more consistently:
expulsion, withdrawal of residence permit, loss of German citizenship.
• close mosques where hatred and anti-Semitism are preached. Islamism is not above the law.
• show right-wing extremists the red card and fight them with full force based on the package
of measures we launched in 2020.
• take an equally consistent approach to left-wing extremism. We will not allow open calls for
violence against our state or attacks on the property of third parties or critical
infrastructure.
• consistently punish the display of anti-constitutional symbols as well as anti-constitutional
and anti-Semitic statements. The rule of law must be enforced.
• arm ourselves with a new form of Customs Police Force to skim off the profits of crime. From
villas to yachts, criminals will have to prove the origin of their wealth in the future. Crime
must not pay off.

Taking responsibility in Europe and the world
We must become stronger geopolitically and advocate our legitimate national interests more
strategically instead of patronising our international partners.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• stand for a Europe that is developing in the right direction – less bureaucracy and more
competitiveness.
• strengthen the transatlantic partnership as the foundation of the Western world, especially
in turbulent times.
• revitalise our relations with France and Poland: We will set the tone in the fight against
illegal immigration for the economy, innovation, security, and defence, and we will expand
our infrastructure in the direction of our neighbouring countries.
• create a National Security Council based in the Federal Chancellery. It is how we will link
foreign, security, defence, trade, European and development policy.
• support Ukraine through diplomatic, financial, and humanitarian means and with arms
deliveries. This way, we will also defend our freedom. We stand by Israel in its legitimate
fight against terror.

-5-
For freedom, peace, and security
Peace and freedom are the guiding principles of our security policy. To achieve this, we will
build a strong military (Bundeswehr).
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• reintroduce conscription. It is necessary for the peace and security of our country.
• commit to the two per cent goal – and no less. NATO is our security guarantee.
• strengthen our security and defence industry. We want more collaboration and production
in Europe regarding sourcing materials and equipment.
• take the lead in building a European missile defence shield. The aerial threat is more
significant than ever.

Living our guiding culture and social cohesion
Our country has established rules and standards, which must be recognised and respected
by everyone who wants to live here. We stand by our guiding culture.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• introduce mandatory integration agreements. For a clear commitment to our values! Our
goal is to monitor and demand integration closely.
• create better starting opportunities through various German and integration courses.
Everyone must be clear about the following: Integration will not succeed without speaking
German.
• reverse the previous government’s express naturalisation and the general possibility of
dual citizenship. The German passport is at the end of the integration process, not at the
beginning.
• relieve the burden on sports clubs and those volunteering to help others. We will
significantly increase the allowances for volunteers and sports coaches.
• commit to a mandatory gap year. It opens opportunities for young people and creates a new
sense of unity.
• prevent a remotely controlled Islam. We need to put an end to the influence of foreign
governments over mosque associations and Islamic organisations for German Muslims!

Supporting families, taking responsibility
Families carry society and create stability. We aim to give families enough leeway to organise
their lives independently.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• improve parental leave and benefits. They give families more time and support the desire
for task sharing.
• work towards bringing the child allowance in line with the basic allowance for parents.
Accordingly, we will also increase child benefits. We also want to keep the marital income
tax break and give more consideration to children in the future demand high-quality
childcare provision.
• We want a good provision of childcare places. We will also increase the tax deductibility of
childcare costs.

-6-
• repeal the previous government’s Self-Determination Act. The protection of minors and
the educational rights of parents must not be undermined.

For exemplary education
Children are our future, and all children need the best possible start in life. The key to this is
a functioning, reliable education system.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• commit to compulsory language tests at pre-school age. Children with speech difficulties
must attend a daycare centre or preschool.
• put effort and performance back at the centre of attention, starting with core subjects such
as maths and the German language and extending to the Federal Youth Sports Competition
(Bundesjugendspiele).
• demand a high-level baccalaureate that is comparable nationwide. There can be no
compromise on the requirements.
• support the development of vocational schools. Every professional matters. We will
promote part-time and further training to increase flexibility at work.
• improve German Federal Law on Support in Education (BAföG) and create opportunities
for additional earnings. We will also ensure that the application process will be less
bureaucratic and faster.

For health and care
We stand for high-quality healthcare that also works reliably in rural areas. We are concerned
with provision for the future, personal responsibility and prevention.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• strengthen health and long-term care structures in urban and rural areas.
• ensure that long waiting times for a doctor’s appointment are reduced. We will also
optimise patient management.
• strengthen the presence of pharmacies and give them a future. For many people, they are
the first point of contact for health problems.
• improve home care and the circumstances of affected relatives. It must be possible to use
nursing services more flexibly.
• tackle the staffing crisis by making the nursing profession more attractive. There must be
more planning and career opportunities.

For building, living and sustainable mobility
Whether in the city or the country, people should be able to live well wherever they call home.
Equivalent living conditions and politics committed to them are needed to achieve this.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
-7-
• make construction affordable. We will thoroughly purge the building and regional planning
laws and significantly and responsibly reduce the regulations to achieve this. Only more and
cheaper construction will ensure more affordable rents.
• allow permanent buildings where only simplified buildings under special regulations were
previously permitted. We will also focus on simple and innovative construction.
• commit to adequate and appropriate tenant protection, including rent control. Social
housing construction must be promoted, and housing benefits must be regularly adjusted.
• make energy-efficient renovation costs deductible from inheritance and gift tax. This is how
we will promote the efficient energy-efficient modernisation of the property portfolio.
• get Germany’s railway company back on track by tackling the infrastructure. Infrastructure
and transport must be separated more clearly than before to increase competition.
• commit to the car and the automotive industry. The ban on combustion engines must be
reversed. The charging infrastructure for e-mobility must be adequately expanded.
• make digital vehicle registration the standard by designing it to be standardised and
uncomplicated nationwide. That also applies to the involvement of the insurers. We will
also introduce the digital vehicle file.

A functioning state is our promise for the future
The previous government was in conflict and destroyed trust. We want to take action and
regain trust. Faster, more efficient, digitally, and with leaner structures.
We are taking action. Now is the time to:
• halve the number of commissioners and manage with at least ten per cent less staff in the
ministerial and parliamentary administration.
• uphold the debt brake enshrined in the German Constitution (Grundgesetz). Today’s debts
are tomorrow’s tax increases.
• protect German savers. We firmly reject all forms of German liability for the debts of other
EU states.
• speed up planning and approval procedures, especially for construction, transport and
digital infrastructure.
• introduce an emergency programme, which will immediately prove that the right policies
can make a difference.
•
Dear voters, dear citizens,
you deserve a government
that governs our country better.

We know how to do it. Furthermore, we are going to govern better.
