            Trump Wins 2024 Presidential Election
          </h2>

          Donald Trump emerged victorious in the 2024 U.S. presidential
          election, marking an unprecedented return to the White House after
          losing in 2020. His win was fueled by a deeply polarized electorate,
          discontent with the prevailing administration, and strong appeal among
          working-class voters, particularly in battleground states. Trumpâ€™s
          campaign focused on economic frustrations, immigration issues, and a
          direct challenge to the justice system, which resonated with his base,
          despite his ongoing legal battles.
